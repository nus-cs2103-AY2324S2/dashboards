Hi all,

I forgot to commit my Level-1 of individual project, so my commit history is Level-0..Level-2..Level-3 etc - maybe cos I was too excited to move on with the project.

I was googling on how to resolve this issue and tried using git rebase, but it seems that it is not so intuitive to insert a new commit between 2 existing commits.

Hello, I don't know whether to post this under the 3rd party libraries, or not.

I was doing the iP, and wondering if I could use regular expressions in the Level 4 - so that I can parse/validate the user input

For example, I want to do this to validate the *todo* command, which is followed by one or more lower case events that are to be added.

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("todo [a-z]+$");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("todo command");

        boolean matchFound = matcher.find();

I hope that it is not case sensitive, since the project did not specify.

If a mixture of upper and lower case is allowed, then we might have to account for cases like `liST`?

Prof @damithc, ~I have decided that I will re-create another project - where I can double check if I have satisfied the requirements along the way again.~ **_Git does not support forking twice_** So in the meantime let me try to see if there is something that i can do. Right now, one commit is having both Level-0 and Level-1 tags

Prof @damithc due to me playing with git rebase - and some of the git history that I did not intend to change was accidentally changed. I decided to delete the old ip project and recreate a new one with the same name.

Learning points

1. Remember to regularly commit and don't get too excited
2. Rebase is a complicated feature, so I should test on another repo before touch the `ip` one

Hi @DominicFuMJ is it possible to show the loop portion how you continuously read in input - until the "bye" command is entered? I suspect that somehow your userInput variable is not being updated say:

```java
while(Loop)``{``
    userInput = myObj.nextLine();
``}``
```

What I recommend you to do is - maybe separate the assignment / initialisation of the variable `userInput`. General idea is as below

```java

String userInput;

while (!userInput.equals("bye")) ``{``
     userInput = myObj.nextLine();
``}``

If I go to one of your commits https://github.com/bgopi23/ip/commit/ed097c1aab108c8f1e686d7f88bac6d8435f9497 , I don't see any warning. Neither does visiting any commit in your tags page https://github.com/bgopi23/ip/tags .

While that method works, it makes the source code excessively long (besides the obvious problem that it won't work when `$SCRIPT_DIR` contains any space). Easier way is to just `cd` into the directory at the start of the script:

```
cd -- "$( dirname -- "$``{``BASH_SOURCE[0]``}``" )"
```

Assuming the script is *executed* and not *sourced* (otherwise the `cd` will affect the bash shell as well, but this can be easily)

Of course, there's always the option of just open a terminal on the side and use `entr` to automatically re-test every time a source file changes.

I was also pretty stumped by the jargon in the question at first, and I had to type out the classes to visualise what the sentence was trying to illustrate.

Suppose you have an is-a relationship between where the Task object is the parent class with the method `execute()`, with its child class having an implementation of `execute()` which overrides the parent's implementation, for example.

``` java
// Task is the type of object seen at compile time
public class Task ``{``
    // ...
    // constructors and attributes omitted for brevity

    // This is the original implementation of execute as seen at compile time, and also the overridden method
    public void execute() ``{``
        System.out.println("Executing task...")
    ``}``
``}``

// Example is the "actual type of object" seen at run time
class Example extends Task ``{``
    // ...
    // constructors and attributes omitted for brevity

    // This is the "implementation in the actual type of object", which is what is resolved to by dynamic binding.
    @Override
    public void execute() ``{``
        System.out.println("Executing task...");
    ``}``
``}``

public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
    Task t = new Example();
    t.execute(); // compiler thinks it prints "Executing task", but actually resolves to execute() in the Example class
``}``
```

I would suggest abstracting the input functionality to a different class, for example Input.java which handles functionality that parses the input.

My solution to the problem was to model the parsing of the input within the class of the chatbot, as the chatbot object would be expected to have the functionality to listen and parse input.

However, I created a main driver class which runs the simulation, and turned Duke.java into its own object with its own functionalities. 

Hope this helped solve your problem!

Personally, I felt like gracefully catching the error and providing the user with feedback instead of terminating gives the user the best experience, as it would prevent the user from having to restart the program again. 

In addition, it would also serve as good practice with exception handling for the tP.

It depends on the user experience you want the user to have, for e.g if you feel making commands case insensitive provides a more seamless experience for users, you can go ahead with that approach.

Other examples I can think of are commands with /from and /to and /by for events and deadlines respectively being useful for users to know if they are explicitly specifying a deadline or event duration, but others may feel that it is obstructive and not very convenient for the user.

Hope I helped!

I am thinking about using enums for commands, but I realised that this would require a refactor as all my functions that take in a command expect a type String. I have a few ways to approach this, but I'm not sure if this is very much worth the refactor
1. Refactor all functions to accept enum of Commands - But this would limit the helper function to only be able to accept Commands enum which I don't think is very extensible
2. Call Commands.LIST.getCommand() where getCommand() is a function to convert the enum to string - I don't really like this syntax because it breaks the purpose of the enum

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡How to understand tagging**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/36" expanded>

After getting confused by what exactly tagging is, heres a simple foolproof-way to doing tagging for iP.  
  
A tag is basically a **bookmark**, it points to a specific commit.  
  
**Add the tag after committing**.   
  
So for example:  
```bash
# this is the commit that implements Level-1
git commit -m "``{``commit message``}``"
git tag -a Level-1 -m "``{``Message or comment for the tag, e.g. Implement Rename, Greet, Exit``}``"

# renaming a commit BEFORE PUSHING
git commit --amend

git push 
git push --tags # this uplaods the tags to GitHub
```

  
A commit can have multiple **tags** but a **tag** can only point to one commit.

Hope this help those who are lost with what are tags exactly.  

You also tag retrospectively, after you have already committed.

Hello, I tried to use [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master) to check the coding standard of my iP.

The xml file that it is checking against is [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml).

I used this config file as the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) stated the following:

However, when I ran the checkstyle.jar file, I encountered many indentation errors which came from the following sections in the [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) file:
```xml
<module name="Indentation">
    <property name="basicOffset" value="2"/>
    <property name="braceAdjustment" value="2"/>
    <property name="caseIndent" value="2"/>

I noticed that this was different from what was specified in the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) page:

May I know if the following modifications are sufficient in utilizing [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master) to check the formatting of my codes?
```xml

To add some personality to the Chatbot, I have been creating functions that randomize the conversations so that it randomly choose the replies, greetings and byes from lists of String. 
However, such methods does not allow for current testing method. I want to ask
  1. Is this approach is not testable?
  2. Is there a workaround? 
If such behaviour is not expected, I will change accordingly.

Apparently, there is something called [Command Line Arguments](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/command-line-arguments-in-java) in Java. Hence I can add an argument to specify test-mode so that the ChatBot behaves predictably upon fetched "test-mode" from terminal.
I will leave this open for 24 hours for more people to suggest more solutions.

Hi, I have the following 2 queries: 

1. Is it an issue if a commit has the wrong **message**? I.e. "Level 5. Automated Text UI Testing" when this is not one of the levels.

2. After pushing tags I noticed newer tags are stacked onto previous commits for past increments. So now my Level-0 commit has tags Level-5 to 0. Is this a major issue for the grader and how do I rectify it?

Thank you!

What I've mainly tried to rectify this: 
Deleted all tags both locally and on remote and ran `git tag <name> <commit hash>` to try to tag it to a specific commit. 

I suspect the issue is coming when I "push all tags" everytime I commit an increment:

Hi all,

I have been stuck on this section for quite a while. I understand that I have to write the expected input and output into their respective txt files. The guide stated we should use input/output redirection. However, I am not sure which folder to test from and what files to feed in(just Duke.java? Or all the .java files in the same folder?) I did not change the folder structure, so Duke is still in `./src/main/java` folder(wrt ip) and the scripts are in `./text-ui-test`. Their lowest common ancestor is the home folder. The app worked perfectly fine in CLI but this happened when I tried input/output redirection:

I tried the given command, but it requires me to give a tagging message. After further research on https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging, looks like we can either make **lightweight** or **annotated** tags.

For **lightweight** tags:
git tag ``{``tagname``}``

For **annotated** tags:
git tag -a ``{``tagname``}`` -m ``{``tagging message``}``

I raise this issue to ask whether we need to specify tagging message when creating tag, and also highlight the attention of the teaching team if any rectification on the given material is required.

If an object is initially declared as type "Object" and instantiated as "Task" for example from iP. If you go to print the object, the toString() method from Task class is run, rather than the base toString() from Object class. This method resolution for overriden methods happens at runtime.

There are two types of binding in java, static binding (early binding ) and dynamic binding (late binding). Overriding methods are resolved using dynamic while overloaded methods are resolved using static binding. The main difference between the two is the stage they take place in, static binding takes place during compile time while dynamic binding takes place during runtime. When you overload a method, the compiler is able to tell which method you're trying to call based on the method signature (name + parameter list). When you use method overriding, the compiler doesn't know which method you're trying to call since the method signature is the same in both subclass and superclass. Take this for example

```
    public static class A ``{``
        void print()
        ``{``
            // Line 1
        ``}``
    ``}``
    public static class B extends A ``{``
        @Override void print()
        ``{``
          // Line 2
        ``}``
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args)
    ``{``
        A a = new A();
        A b = new B();
        a.print()
        b.print()
   ``}``
```
During compile time objects aren't initialized yet, so when we do b.print() we have no idea which function to call, the one in the subclass or the one in the superclass. It is only after dynamic binding during runtime that we actually know which function to call. Hope this helps

@bgopi23 I encountered a similar issue hence ended up in this post, these are my personal findings

1) For Level-0, upon completing my requirements and staging my changes, I did the following:
`git push`
`git push --tags`
This resulted in normal behaviour without the error message.

2) For Level-1,  upon completing my requirements and staging my changes, I did the following:
`git push --tags`
This resulted me in getting the same error as you did (Sorry forgot to screenshot)
Then, as suggested by prof @damithc, I did
`git push`
Which fixed the problem upon refreshing my github page

I suspect that you, like me, are doing `git push --tags`, thinking that this pushes both commits and tags but in reality it only pushes tags. Even though you can see the changes in the code from the tag, I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that its not how version control is meant to be done. From what you have described, it sounds like you have already done multiple "Levels" this way and I'm not sure how you can resolve it from there.

Maybe you can do the following (Someone else please advise if this is okay):
1. Delete all your tags on github and local repo
2. Do `git push` to push all your commits for the levels you have done
3. Tag all the levels you have done (on local repo)
4. Do `git push --tags` to push all the tags

I came up with this suggestion based on this FAQ on the website

> I found that cd-ing into the test folder each time to run it is a pain, so I used a SCRIPT_DIR so that you can run it outside of the folder. Feel free to copy and use.

Instead of using `$SCRIPT_DIR` to store the script's directory and `cd` to it, you can just wrap the script with `pushd` and `popd`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Change the current directory to the directory of this script
pushd "$(dirname "$0")" >/dev/null

# create bin directory if it doesn't exist
# ... the rest of your script

# Change back to the original directory
popd > /dev/null
```

You don't have to add `$SCRIPT_DIR` to every path anymore. 2 additional lines are not excessively long 😛
