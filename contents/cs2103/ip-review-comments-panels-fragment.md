Hi, the course coding standard states that lines should not pass the soft limit of 110 lines, and a hard limit of 120 lines. The oracle coding standard states 80 lines. This line is really long so it could be changed to look (for e.g.) like
```java
throw new FelixException("Command does not follow this format: event ``{``description``}`` "
        + "/from ``{``start_datetime``}`` /to ``{``end_datetime``}``");

Instead of having a `createTask` method inside the `Task` base class itself, which somewhat violates OOP since `Task` "knows" its subclasses, I made another class `TaskFactory` which is responsible for returning the `Task` of the relevant runtime type.

Is this really necessary? Right now, all you use it for is to print the letters. I think it adds very little because the enum is not descriptive enough. For example instead of ```TaskType.T```, I think ```TaskType.ToDo``` would be more appropriate.

In the current iteration, I think even just replacing ```TaskType.X``` in the subclasses with the corresponding ```"X"``` might be better.

Just a suggestion but you could explore using ```String.format()``` to make your code more readable. It is not that bad now because it is still short.

Very nice use of enums and switch statements. This will be my inspiration to implement enums. Do note that the ```case``` and ```default``` statements should have the same indentation as the switch as per coding standard.

I think with a more complicated function for ```userTaskList``` like this, it would be clearer to create a class ```TaskList```, so that in the future, we can easily add functions to the ```userTaskList``` instead of letting the UI complete this function.

Overall great readability. There is one use of enums that I will take inspiration from and another that is not that useful (```TaskType```). Great work! 👍

Hello @macareonie Ryan, I enjoyed interacting with your chatbot. It looks so cool and has a cool personality. In particular, I loved your customisation to the GUI and it was really very refreshing to interact with it.

However, there are somethings that I spotted that you might need to consider adding: JavaDocs to at least 50% of the public methods as specified in `A-JavaDoc` Level.

There are some minor problems with the formatting of the code which I have pointed out. I would maybe recommend you to make use of the A-CheckStyle level where these issues can easily surface and be resolved.

In addition, I think you can consider storing all the "hard-coded" String messages as a constant - so that it will be easily changed if necessary.

It was great learning from you!

Thank you very much.

Have a nice day.

Best regards,
Jerome

Perhaps you can consider alternative ways of performing String concatenation as the `+` operator in Java is a very inefficient way of performing it. I would recommend using the `String.format()` method provided by the String class or using a `StringBuilder` instance to store intermediate states of a String message.

Overall, it LGTM. I am really amazed by the level of organization in your codes and the handling of cases in a clear and concise manner. Some Nits I have is where you sometimes lack consistency in using the `this` keyword, the `InvalidCommandException` class being located in the `commands` package instead of the `exceptions` package and using `+` operators in many printing methods instead of perhaps using String.format().

Perhaps more edge cases can be considered? This also applies to commands of delete, mark/unmark, find etc. that have a number or keyword as additional info used in the commands.

Maybe you should try to implement checkstyle or revisit the coding standards webpage? It is not familiar to us, but the `case` statements should not be indented with respect to the `switch` statement based on our shared coding standard. The IDES normally have auto-styling on which indents for us on save / exit so you will have to be careful and prevent your styling changes from being reverted even after you have removed the indents. On Windows, the shortcut would be to highlight the entire block of `case` statements then press shift + tab to shift the block towards the left.

I like your use of a `HashSet&lt;String>` to keep track of list of allowed commands in your program, thereby reducing the time needed to retrieve the types of a command from instead maybe a list. But perhaps it would be more well suited to be stored and referenced as a static field in the `Command` class instead so that you would not have to instantiate a `saveCommands` object every time you do a predicate check with this method?

Perhaps you can consider to modify the return type of the method to `ArrayList&lt;Task>` and return `matches` directly? in calling `matches.toArray(new Task[0])`, we would be performing double the work by populating two separate data structures to hold the same data which is wasteful.

The overall class design LGTM. Overall, I am very delighted that you used various advanced OOP concepts like overloading, overriding and inheritance to a very large extent. However, there were certain coding standard violations too. Firstly, your classes were missing class header comments which is a requirement, secondly, there were certain methods that kept instantiating new instances of data structures which could have otherwise been avoided, lastly, there were some methods which fulfill more than one purpose, perhaps you can consider extracting different functionalities into its individual methods.

I've reviewed your PR briefly, found just a bunch of nits. Mainly confused about your storage code and why you decided to do the things you did there

I also found a few coding standard violations but not a whole lot. You added comments to almost if not every function and class, good job! Although, I'm of the opinion that some comments can be left out if they're not particularly useful. And also, some comments that you wrote were not particularly descriptive either, like "isExit"

LGTM now. But later in the future, you may be facing on how to separate the code in this taskListMode() method. You may try to separate the execution of each of the command to its class. For an example, you can only mark or unmark a task, you may consider adding methods in your Task class, to unmark or mark the specific task. Then, the code in this method when the command is mark or unmark you can just simply using the method you created and making the code shorter. This will be allow you easy to change while you are in increments A-More-OOP later.

Very basic way of handling exceptions. Consider creating a new Exception class so you can consolidate your exceptions and have different behavior for different types of Exceptions.

Method Names could be clearer. parse() could be renamed into executeCommand() instead. 
Methods like find, delete, mark addDeadline, addEvent could be renamed into findTask, deleteTask, markTaskAsDone, addDeadlineTask, addEventTask for more clarity.
Overall not a bad attempt however more OOP could be used. The Ui class is currently parsing input strings, processing business logic, and handling output all at the same time. You could separate the command parsing into a different class and allow the Ui class to solely handle text generation

Method names seem inconsistent. toDoException could be renamed to printToDoException. successfulFind and unsuccessfulFind could be renamed to printFound() and printNotFound(). Since the Printer class solely handles output, methods should have consistent naming.

Overall Good attempt but method names could use more consistent naming. UI class is currently handling too many functions and could be split up more. Exception handling is a bit weird as it doesn't actually catch any exceptions. LiteException class should extend Exception so you can actually use try catch blocks to handle exceptions.

Suggestion: could initialize another int object for index - 1, so that you don't have to use 'index - 1' in full form twice. It could also improve readability if you were to give a name for index - 1 (why did you do this, what does this mean?)

In general it seems that it would be better if you add a blank line before the `@param` block in all your JavaDoc. In addition, it would be more faithful to coding standard if you phrase the description like `Determines which type of command to generate from input`, which foregrounds the action verb (in third person singular).

Here are some things that I thought could be improved upom
- Javadoc could follow the coding standard more closely
- There seems to be a refactoring problem of `Command` being changed to `duke.command.Command` in class descriptions
- A few variables and fields could be named more descripively.

But overall I really liked it!

I am a little confused what this method does, and I am not completely understanding what the Javadoc is saying either. Is this something that the user should change? What if they download your release as a .jar file? If this method has been completed, it might be good to revise the Javadoc to give a more informative description of the method, including `@param` and `@return`.

Might be a redundant if check. You can just split the string and verify if the mark/ unmark is present, while also ensuring the length of the split instruction is 2. This way, you confirm the task name's presence without extra checks. This might be applicable for other commands as well.

Since your current `greet()`, `showLoadingError()` and `exit()` methods are all displaying in nature, showing the Ui, it would be more readable if they all have similar naming!

Nice that you added a header comment for this method, but it is actually not required since it's a getter :) Noticed that you omitted the header comment for some others e.g. getDescription() from your Task class, can try to keep it consistent across the different classes as to whether you'd want to include or omit header comments for getters and setters!

minor issue, but since this method is an action/handles something (and is not a noun/thing), can consider renaming to start with a verb, e.g. `handleMarkedTask`

I think its more apparent in this class, just wanted to point out your use of similar naming conventions for related methods! e.g. `markTask`, `unMarkTask`, `findTask`, `removeTask` - naming these methods similarly does help make your code readable! good job!

Looks good to me overall. Might want to consider applying some more OOP principles to the code, for instance, to encapsulate the handling of different commands within a Command class perhaps? 

Could also make use of packages a bit more. For instance, maybe you would like to consider putting the UI implementation into a separate package that can then be easily modified if we want to change something about the UI without breaking the other code?

Nice use of comments to note things to do in the future!

## Tip:
Adding the keyword `TODO:` in front of comments could be useful as some IDEs will list them in the `Problems` tool window. This will help you remember which parts of the code you have marked as todos.

```java
// TODO: Update the title above to match the actual product name

// TODO: Product screenshot goes here

// TODO: Product intro goes here

Maybe it be easier to save your logged values in a comma / hyphen separated format, the logged values could be the components needed for the constructor of your task.

This would allow you to directly create the needed task using it's own constructor.

Additionally, this could also possibly make parsing the input easier too, as you can just call a .split(",") on a new line read by the buffered reader.

This could make this portion of the code lot clearer and reduce the code you have to manage :)

Overall great job!

I liked that you tried to identify and handle a large amount of errors and your code is clean and easy to read with aptly named variables.

However, it would be great to see more your classes being organised in packages and abstracted out from each other as per the more OOP class.

Overall, you have done a good job!

However, I would suggest you explore extracting the commands into their separate classes to make the codebase more extensible.

Neat work! Follows the coding standards well. However, some overall comments, apart from ones provided:
- Please consider breaking the program into classes and packages. It will improve code readability.

The switch statement should not have indentation for case clauses. Can configure IDE settings to make things easier.

Other than uppercasing constant variables and removing indentation for switch statement, overall coding standard has been adhered to. Possible nitpick would be ensuring the import statements are consistent through out the classes, such as whether there is a line break in between different dependencies or not.

Overall, really nice and clean code to read! 👍

Would there be less duplication if a static final variable was used to store the string here? Consider the case that the developer decides to make minor changes to this string, if the string was stored "INVALID_TASK_NUMBER = ...", and all other codes reference that, at least only that constant needs to be edited rather than all other instances where it was used 😃

Would it be easier to use String.format() like in the following image, instead of having many concatenation operators?

Is there a way to keep track of loose strings like "save" in a constant or enum? A central area to store such strings as constants can make a large codebase more readable. The benefits are as follows
1. can go to a command enum file or command constants to see all types of commands
2. can change all instances of the same "save" command, by changing the string saved in a constant or enum to "update"

Good job Regan, just some nits.

Strong OOP and good handling of exceptions. I focused more on syntax and standards, rather than functional. Hope they are useful. Additionally, some of the methods could be made private without changing functionality of the code, but up to you if you would like to implement it that way.

Overall great job! 😄

Perhaps could omit the 'this' keyword? I previously asked my TA about it and she mentioned this:
I got a question from one of your classmates regarding the this keyword. Use of this is discouraged, potentially to avoid unnecessary noise in the code. Try to avoid using this except when it is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter. This is an advanced rule that is optional to follow for CS2103T.

Might want to avoid deep nesting 😄 

By using guard clauses you can do stuff like:

```java
if (words.length != 2) ``{``
    throw new ...
``}``
// rest of your code
...
```

The deeper the nesting, the harder it is for the keep track of the logic!

I realised these `DukeException` are the same in `unmarkTask` and `markTask` you can make a new subclass that inherits `DukeException` with the error message declared in the class. 
  
So if you ever need to change the message you or reuse it you can just use the class.

Coding quality, make the happy path prominent. 

No need for the `else` for `!command.contains(" ")`

You can do like a guard clause style for easier readability and avoid complicated nesting.  
  
```java
if (tasks.isEmpty()) ``{``
    // fail check
    System.out.println();
    return;
``}``
// rest of your code
...
```

The `return` will ensure the remaining code will not be executed anyways so no need for else.

Code seems good.  👍   
Keep it up! 😄   
  
Some points to take note of, if-else are good but don't nest too much of them.  
  
Take note i think your taskList.txt is **not actually plaintext**.  
So it might be wrong to actually give it as `.txt` file extension.  
This is because serialisation stores the Java object.

I think you could consider implementing your conditional statement in the getStatus() instead of returning boolean, as in the detailsAsString() method, you did the conditional statement in the additions of strings.

I like that you main method does not have much lines, but I think you could consider creating other class, using packages to structure your files better as well, especially in the taskListMode() method where it looks a bit clunky, I think you consider create perhaps a Command package and add the different command classes.

**Review Status:** COMMENTED

Relevant parts of code are in appropriate classes, making it easy to read and track.
Some minor violations were noted, but nothing major.
Most classes were tested which is very good.
Test cases have to be split into different methods, so that if 1 test case fails early on, the rest can still run.

`this.name`, `this.start`, and `this.end` don't need the `this` as there are no conflicting names in the local scope. According to the standard, it's better to leave the `this` out in this case, so  I think removing the `this` here and in some other parts of the code I'm seeing will be cleaner.

Hello :). I'm a peer reviewer for your iP this week. This is my first review (the coding standard one).

As far as I can see, you have followed the coding standard really closely, so I don't have much to comment. I have just pointed out some nits (and some general comments), but otherwise LGTM!
</panel>

<panel  header="**8 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/ip/pull/381#discussion_r1481164891" expanded>

I feel that the `handle` prefix is redundant. `mark` is a verb already, and it describes what is being done. Therefore, maybe returning mark will make it more concise. If the usage of the function is to be made clearer,  I think maybe something like `markTask` would be better. (Then you could also change taskIndex to just index as it would be pretty obvious what it's indexing imo)

Similar sentiment for the other functions this class.

I've seen this constant being used for both input and output, so maybe just `DATE_FORMATTER` might be better.

Okay this line has thrown me in a bit of a loop. You have used both INPUT and OUTPUT for output in this case so I'm not really sure what different significance they have. Maybe you can try changing the names or splitting into other variables to make this more obvious?

Honestly having all of the `INVALID`s in the UI is an interesting choice. It brings all of the CLI text into one place which would make it easier to edit and understand how the text looks as a whole. However, it does make understanding what the exceptions say when reading the code. I don't have a particular recommendation, but imo having the messages where they're used, i.e. the exceptions, would be better.
</panel>

I see that this is overriding the superclass. Maybe you could add @Override to this and to the same function in other subclasses to make this obvious.

It's a bit hard to understand what the parameters do. From the code it seems that the `parametersString` is the input to extract the parameters from, but I don't see any use for parameters other than its length. Adding a javaDoc header might help. If the only use for parameters is the length I think that passing the length itself is better.

`Process` is vague. It doesn't really indicate what the `processing` is. I think changing to `make` or maybe `create` would describe what this is doing better.

Instead of catching the `NumberFormatException` and printing out the index here, I feel that it might be better to have another exception whose message itself has the index with the specific command. That would would express the intent of the exception in the code better imo.

Hello :). I'm a peer reviewer for your iP! I'm doing my second review for you (the code quality one). I have some recommendations, but overall I think that your code is readable and well structured.

One overarching suggestion is that you could move Task and its subclasses into a bob.task package. I feel like that would make their relation more obvious.

I like that you have made every method and variable as intuitive as possible and liked that you have added JavaDocs for most, if not all important functions. I think there are some coding standards conventions you have missed from the guide such as the `switch` `case` alignment as well as explicit import of classes. Apart from that, LGTM.👍

I have noticed that you have put a lot of effort into developing Duke to be something special to you and I like the personality of the bot you have made. I did notice a few issues with regards to the given Java conventions and I think you have missed out (styling of `switch` `case` in some areas). Perhaps you can look into your IDE settings and configure them to follow the respective guidelines and it will help to automatically reformat the code on save which will save time when refactoring. Overall great job and hope to see more progress. 😄

I see that you have been making progress with the program as you are starting to incorporate more classes to better manage your programs. I think that the program can be further improved by using names more representative of what the variable is.

I concur! The [Java Coding Standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#layout) shows no indentation for case and default clauses in a switch statement. IntelliJ or the IDE of your choice could be set to do this automatically for you.

Code is generally easy to read 👍 
Some coding styles to note:
1. All imports should be explicit.
2. Note the styling of JavaDoc comments (parameter description).
3. Case and default clauses in switch statements should not have indentation.

Otherwise, the naming of classes, variables and methods are descriptive and easy to understand. LGTM!

a nitpick i have is that maybe you can try to further standardise their names. for eg: dateError has Error behind it whereas no other exceptions has Error behind their name. Maybe you can try to include it so for eg invalidInputError, missingIndexError and etc. Also, for your DateOutOfRange, i realised that none of the other errors have their first letter capitalised so maybe you can consider changing it if you want

Should Task be an abstract class at this point? From my understanding, there is no command to add a Task at the current stage, and thus there shouldn't be a need to instantiate an instance of the Task object. At the same time, the toString() methods for the subclasses of Task share a lot of similar code; would it be better to extract the common parts and place them in a helper method in Task instead?

As someone who has recently done this increment I know it's because they asked us to accept and display the dates in different formats, but to someone who isn't familiar with the application requirements this might be a little confusing.

Would it be better if a different name was used, instead of naming the string as `isDone`
Perhaps using `markedStatus` or `doneChar` would be clearer?

Or maybe keeping the name but instead convert it to a boolean using `input[4].equals('X') ? true : false`

It seems for this function, you may have missed a white space after the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`

There appears to be one other location, in the `addToDoTest` method in `TaskListTest`, that is missing a white space.

I don't think this import statement follows the [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#naming). The package name `Exceptions` should be in lowercase to differentiate from class names. I've noticed this in other parts of the PR as well.

I don't think it's necessary to have specialised method for each of the the Task subclasses. The `add(Task)` method would already capture all of the subclasses because of Java polymorphism. It would also make it easier to add other types of Tasks later.

@Colex2000 You use `filePath` as both a parameter in your constructor (which you use in your `main` method in line 125, and as a instance variable (in line 17). I think this is an instance of variable shadowing which might lead to unforeseen bugs in the future. You might want to consider only using one instance of `filePath`.

### General
Hey, I like how you implemented your command system. I know this is not part of my job as the first reviewer but I just wanted to give you some ideas if you are interested: consider having a dispatcher class that takes in `String command` and sends out executables that perform an action when their .execute() method is called. You can refer to my codebase if interested :) All these are extra but may help make your codebase look cleaner.

Would it be more specific to constrain the List&lt;Task> type to ArrayList&lt;Task>? Instead of the abstract class. This may prevent other List data structures like Queue/Stack to be passed into the function, which could interfere with the intended outcome of any add/remove/search methods you have.

Generally, your code is well written and organized. There are some areas where there can be slight improvements to exploit the usage of the `UI` class. Also, for the `Task` classes, consider the changes as it helps with futureproofing and ease of addition of additional classes, since the author _(may not be you if not an individual project!)_ need not remember to initialise `boolean isExit` to false. :)

Would it be better if you provided more documentation on how the store and decode works? I only realised that you were storing the task as a string directly in the toString() format of each Task and then using decode() to parse this stored string back into a representative ItemList object after cross referencing both your store() and decode() methods. 

There may be other ways of doing this which may warrant your documentation on how you've implemented storage functionality. Otherwise, its a pretty neat implementation of storing Tasks 👍

Any reason why you did user input validation in `DukeException.java` instead of `Duke.java`?

Overall, I found your code easy to read - following the coding standard and naming conventions for the most part. I like how you separated each class to handle one thing each.

I agree with this! According to our coding standard, **constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words (aka SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)**

Overall, I found your code easy to read for the most part except a few places where the loops were in a single line and were difficult to read. Perhaps you could try wrapping them in braces and putting them in a separate line, and possibly separating them with empty lines. I noted a few minor coding standard violations too.

I really like how the method here is short and easy to understand but do you think it might perhaps be better to rename the method to just `greet()` ?

I really appreciate how intuitive this method is but do you think it would be good if you could phrase it as `bootingUp()` or `initialiseItemList()`?  The rationale for this proposed change is because since this method will be called as the first touch point between your local file storage and your ItemList object when you want to load the content from the file to the ItemList object, would it paint a clearer picture if you were to use the proposed method name?

Overall, I found your code easy to read for the most part except a few places
where the nesting was too deep. Maybe splitting to different classes makes it more readable. I noted a few minor coding standard violations
too. The main class are getting quite long. Consider splitting into
smaller classes and method if that makes sense.

Interesting way to handle and parse the command string! It may be a bit unintuitive to grasp at first glance, but I suggest a better simplification could be achieved using Pattern Matching with Regular Expressions! You can checkout the Parser class in addressbook2 for reference.

Would the null check here be necessary? Rather than nesting your DukeException try catch in Parser, you can bring it up to this level and share this level of try catch, wouldn't that be better? The currentCommand object seems to be a redundant duplicate of parsedCommand too :D

In the writeToFile method, the use of FileWriter in append mode (new FileWriter(filePath, true)) is highlighted as redundant due to the explicit file deletion logic. Append mode inherently handles the creation of a new file if it doesn't exist, and appends data to the end of an existing file. Therefore, the manual deletion of the file prior to writing is unnecessary and could be removed to streamline the process.

Overall, the code is very well-written. I particularly appreciate the use of object-oriented programming principles, evident in the separation of classes to function independently. Aside from the common oversight of not using lowercase for package names and a few minor logical issues, I would say it's an excellent effort.

It seems that your code have deep nesting. Perhaps the code block can be simplified? Here is an example of a deeply nested (or arrowhead style) code:
```java
int subsidy() ``{``
    int subsidy;
    if (!age) ``{``
        if (!sub) ``{``
            if (!notFullTime) ``{``
                subsidy = 500;
            ``}`` else ``{``
                subsidy = 250;
            ``}``
        ``}`` else ``{``
            subsidy = 250;
        ``}``
    ``}`` else ``{``
        subsidy = -1;
    ``}``
    return subsidy;

1. Perhaps combine multiple `try...catch` blocks into one? I also noticed that you catch `Exception` instead of specifying the specific exception to catch (e.g. `IOException` or `FileNotFoundException`) which is something we what to avoid (I subconsciously remembered in one of the briefing video @damithc mentioned something along the lines of "Don't catch them all" but I can't seem to find it in the textbook). Also, take note to catch all checked exceptions (refer to W1.5 [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week1/topics.html#W1-5)) The following example might also fix your issues.
```java
try ``{``
    <your code>
``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
    <your code>
``}`` catch (FileNotFoundException e) ``{``
    <your code>
``}``
```
2./3./4./5./6. Perhaps the blocks can be abstracted into smaller methods.

Not really sure if mine is a good example but maybe you can take some inspiration [here](https://github.com/SimKianSeng/ip/blob/master/src/main/java/simpli/storage/Storage.java)?

As everyone has different implementations it's quite hard for me to tell you what is right, but I can point out what doesn't seem right to me and maybe provide you with the reference materials. Hope this was helpful.

I noticed that there's a lot of `try|catch` clauses scattered across the code. I think that works but you might want to consider just throwing the error and than catching it on a higher level (i.e the main loop). Would help to make your code look cleaner.

Sick use of regex and I learnt about the fact you could use `|` to union error types in the catch clause. Overall looks great! Thou be smashin' this iP 🔥

I feel like you should name your class as `Todo` instead of `Todos` since this is technically not a collection of Todos. Also considering that you named your parent class `Task` instead of `Tasks` and `Deadline` instead of `Deadlines` I feel that you should stick to the singular naming convention.

Avoid using wildcard imports. You can tweak the settings in IntelliJ IDEA to avoid wildcard imports because they have some default number of before they start converting them to wildcard imports.

It seems like almost all the exceptions extend InvalidTaskException; even ones like InvalidCmdException.

Can consider abstracting the code for each case into new functions as your run code looks a little crowded.

I believe that majority of Java classes should not be plural? The coding standard does not explicitly state this for class names. But just like the parent class Task, I think it might make more sense for Deadline to be singular. Like wise for some of the other classes.

There should be a space between 'if' and the open bracket '('.

I don't think the coding standard mentions anything about leaving blank lines after the declaration of a method or class, but is there a reason why you do this? The toString method above does not have the blank line for example.

In all the other classes I also see many blank lines in random spots... Not sure if they are placed there on purpose but I can't really understand the logic of having those spaces at those spots.

Refering to the coding standard for switch commands the identations are different from what we might be used to. The lines of 'case' statements should be on the same identation level as the 'switch' statement itself. Only the items within the cases needs to be further indented

In general, I am quite impressed with the structure of your code and your implementation of OOP principles. It offers a seamless and easily comprehensible experience for users who are reviewing your code for the first time, allowing them to grasp the functionality of each class and the relationships between them. Your Javadoc is also well-written, although I would suggest adding a bit more detail to certain classes I have commented on, as it would further aid understanding of individual functions and variables. Nevertheless, overall, GOOD JOB!

Overall, great attempt at fulfilling the requirements for the IP. I feel that the code structure could be improved? A lot of logic can be abstracted out to separate methods to improve readability and maintainability? Perhaps you can consider creating more packages specifically for tasks and exceptions instead of one single package with all the files.

Consider using constants for the date formats and declaring them as private static final fields at the top of the class. Doing so would make the method more generalised and if you needed to change the format, you would only need to change the constants instead of going to each method where it's used and changing it.

Creating a new `TaskList` instance in each condition is unnecessary. Instead, perhaps create a single instance at the beginning of the method, and then use it as needed in each condition. This reduces the amount of duplicate code.

The execute method could be more concise. Perhaps you could break down this method into smaller methods, each responsible for a specific command type.

Example:

```ruby
public String execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage) throws DukeException ``{``
    switch (type) ``{``
        case BYE:
            return executeBye();

            return executeList(tasks);
        case TODO:
            return executeTodo(tasks, storage);
        // ...
        default:
            throw new DukeException("Unexpected command type: " + type);
    ``}``
``}``

private String executeBye() ``{``
    return "Goodbye! Hope to see you again soon!";
``}``

private String executeList(TaskList tasks) ``{``
    // ...
``}``

private String executeTodo(TaskList tasks, Storage storage) throws DukeException ``{``
    // ...
``}``

Consider using a constant for the date format and declaring it as private static final field at the top of the class. Doing so would make the method more generalised and if you needed to change the format, you would only need to change the constant instead of going to each method where it's used and changing it.

Example:
```ruby
private static final String DATE_TIME_FORMAT = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm";
```

Similarly for the declarations in Deadline.java

Maybe can consider customizing the error messages for different types of errors to enhance the user experience, instead of solely relying on printStackTrace(). Besides that, I am not sure if the string parsing approach used here is a bit of hard coding, which could lead to maintenance issues if the structure of the input data changes. For example, if 'event' is modified to another word, all the substrings with specific indices need to be adjusted accordingly. 

One alternative approach is to use a delimiter, such as "|" to separate different fields in the input data. This would allow for easier parsing using methods like split() rather than relying on substrings with specific indices.

Since other instances of the word unmark for e.g. in `TaskList` class, you treated it as 2 separate words i.e.
```

        task.markNotDone();

Remember to make your class name and class file capitalised! should be Gops.java and 

```
public class gops ``{``
```

----------------------------------------------------------
From further inspection, you might have gone with gops.java because it clashes with the package name. I think you can refactor and rename your **package name** to ```gops``` instead, as by coding standards package names should not be capitalised. That way, you will be able to capitalise your gops.java :)

More of a coding standard violation, but note that test functions should be named by a specific standard as stated in the [Java Coding Standards](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html):

>Underscores may be used in test method names using the following three part format featureUnderTest_testScenario_expectedBehavior()

>e.g. sortList_emptyList_exceptionThrown() getMember_memberNotFound_nullReturned

>Third part or both second and third parts can be omitted depending on what's covered in the test. For example, the test method sortList_emptyList() will test sortList() method for all variations of the 'empty list' scenario and the test method sortList() will test the sortList() method for all scenarios.

this `isExit` doesn't seem like its being used / the variable is being shadowed in `run()`. This makes it quite confusing to know whether the function-local `isExit` is being used or the object variable `isExit` is being used.

Instead of taking in the `file` and the `fileParent`, you could derive the parent path from the full file path. 

For example
```java
import java.io.File;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
Path path = Paths.get(filepath);
File directory = path.getParent().toFile();
directory.mkdirs();
this.file = path.toFile();
this.file.createNewFile();
```
The above code would get the Path of the directory, create it if it hasn't been created, and then create the file if it hasn't been created also.

One way to make the code cleaner is to have a default impl for isExit, 
```java

Since most commands don't exit by default, and we can override this in the ExitCommand to return true

Perhaps you can rename 'isDoneIcon' to 'iconIsDone'? The 'is' in front is typically used for boolean variable types so doing this might reduce ambiguity. However, I understand that it's just an icon depicting whether or not the Task isDone, so it's not really an issue. Just a suggestion!

Avoid complicated expressions and definitions. Your method `checkCommandIdentity` gets the userCommand by checking for string equivalence, then uses the userCommand to perform a conditional switch case check. This can be combined into 1 and reduce redundant checkings and simplify your method to make it more easily readble

Javadocs not present in some classes and methods. While there are some comments for methods and classes, the format should look something like this:

The lecture topic for Week 4 content suggests that:

> A name is not just for differentiation; it should explain the named entity to the reader accurately and at a sufficient level of detail.

Considering the method in line 52 is called `toString`, which generates a `String` as its return value, a reader may naturally interpret it as **a function that describes the object as text**.

However, the method name for line 60 is called `toSaveString`. A reader may not have a clear idea about "what a SaveString is", or may interpret the function as **a function that saves a string somewhere**. These two interpretations are clearly incorrect if the reader reviews the method implementation.

Therefore as a suggestion, perhaps it will be good to give the function a better name? One of the example that comes to my mind is `toStringForSaveInFile`.

Noticed that within these part of codes, you have used `s`, `t`, `d`, and `e` as your variable name. Perhaps name formed by single character is more suitable for temporary usage such as loop variable, but for here I think giving a more complete variable name can effectively improve the readability of code.

the "success" word may not be necessary since there is already exception handling in your code that produces the error messages. hence, there is no onAddFailure() function to print the error message. I think the function name can also be more descriptive. e.g showAddedTask()

Even though some parts could have been made more clear, such as splitting longer methods into shorter ones, I would say that your code is quite easy to read.

Overall, the code was very interesting to read! It is good that you put all the relevant classes into different packages, making it more readable and easy to understand the code structure. However, I noticed that some methods implemented were quite long. I think you can try to break the longer methods down by creating more shorter methods so that it can increase readability. 
LGTM. Just a few nits to fix.

Implement the toString() method in your Task.java.
This way you can call it by super.toString() in each of the subclasses of Task.java.
This is helpful since each of the subclasses toString() methods have commonalities in the string it prints.
For reference, this is mine:
 String check = isDone ? "[X] " : "[ ] ";

Its a good practice to omit the `this` keyword when accessing class members and you should only use it when there are ambiguous variable names in the scope (i.e. in constructors or when your method arguments have the same

Overall, the code is quite readable, and it follows the coding standard very well, other than a view minor nitpicks. Also, I noticed that currently there is some mismatch between the names in the project (e.g. filename says Adam.java but package and class name is Ada) but maybe it's because you haven't completely refactored everything yet so its not a problem for me. 👍

I think the method they were looking for might be `toString()`? Based on how this method is used I think that would be a more appropriate name. Also, another benefit of overriding `toString()` instead of writing an entirely new method is because then Java can automatically call it whenever the object needs to be converted to a String (i.e. string concatenation or passing objects as arguments to `System.out.println()`).
```suggestion
    public String toString() ``{``
```

It's not necessary to use the keyword `super` here, and I think it makes the code harder to read. On the other hand, `super.stringify()` is definitely an appropriate usecase for it so good job for that👍. Basically, you should only use `super` when you need the superclass's implementation of the method instead of the one in your current class.
```suggestion
        if (isMarked())
            m = "[X]";
        else
            m = "[ ]";

As mentioned above, if you override `toString()` instead of using `stringify()` you should be able to print your tasks like this.

For the naming of the function, maybe the verb 'validate' is not so accurate in describing the task it does. 'Validate' might make people think this function is just doing the validation and would return some boolean value or void, but this function actually breaks the deadlineInput down and put the result into an array and returns this array.

Hi, I have been tasked to do a PR review on your code. I will be reviewing on coding standard violations only

1. `execute_normalInput_success()` in AddCommandTest.java should be camelCase instead eg: `executeNormalInputSuccess()`, same goes for the other test functions there.

2. Good job making the screen logo in `Ui.java` here!
```
 String logo =
                "                     ____            _     _       \n" +

                "                    | |_) |_   _  __| | __| |_   _ \n" +
                "                    |  _ <| | | |/ _` |/ _` | | | |\n" +
                "                    | |_) | |_| | (_| | (_| | |_| |\n" +
                "                    |____/ \\__,_|\\__,_|\\__,_|\\__, |\n" +
                "                                              __/ |\n" +

```
But since its a variable that will not change, I recommend you changing it to `private final String LOGO`

Other than that, good job for the rest of the project, the structuring of the project was very intuitive

Hi, I am tasked to do a PR review on your code. I will be reviewing based on code quality guidelines

1. In your `Parser.java`, I see that you have repeated 
```
System.out.println("____________________________________________________________");
``` 
a lot, maybe you can consider creating a variable `private final String LINE`
2. In `Storage.java`, you have 
```
int endIndex = message.lastIndexOf("(");
int startIdx = message.indexOf(":");
```
It would be nice if you can standardise if you want to name them Index or Idx.

Other than that, the rest of the code looks good! LGTM.

Some minor inconsistency with the naming here, the first method is `void printWithLines()` which is fine and we expect it to print something behind the abstraction. The second method is `void showLoadingError()`, which is also fine since it will serve as a UI abstraction that shows the error on the UI. However, the last method is `String showWelcome()`, which also starts with show, which would indicate serving as a UI abstraction that shows the welcome, however it just returns a String. Perhaps it could be renamed `getWelcomeString()`, or the implementation could directly use `printWithLines()`.

Using `logic` as a variable name might not be very clear as it is not apparent what it is, but naming it with an 'is_' prefix is also not right as it isn't exactly a boolean, maybe you could rename this to `marked` or something similar, just a suggestion.

final and constant are not the same thing though, typically constants refer to class members, final just means it cannot be modified after instantiation. I think it's fine that they are not all capitalised since they are instance fields, however perhaps if the variables are class members, and then they should be in all caps.

I think ternary operations should be written like this (present in other places as well):
```
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression) ? beta : gamma;
alpha = (aLongBooleanExpression)
        ? beta
        : gamma;

Overall, most of your method and class names are appropriate and sensible choices! A few of them have some ambiguity (you can see my comments below), especially those related to class names inheriting the `Command` class - as writing a verb in front of the command noun, such as `AddCommand`, may lead to confusion with the action of adding a command. Otherwise, LGTM!

Not a coding standard violation and this is fine, but can consider having a `completionIcon()` method which returns "[ ]" or "[X]" depending on the boolean isCompleted status instead of statically using if & else to determine which one to print

then this method can just be `return this.completionIcon() + " " + this.description`

will be neater if you decide to add more components to this `toString()` method in the future as you have more control over the individual components :)

You might achieve better encapsulation if `TaskList` is agnostic to the types of tasks it can contain. So a general method of `addTask` may be more suitable. Though this is entirely up to your discretion.

For this portion, I would suggest starting the line with String.format. There is no need to + removedTask as that already uses the toString method. Instead doing String.format("Noted...\n%s...", removedTask.toString()...) would allow you to view the entire string as if you were reading a whole sentence or paragraph.

Should this be extracted out?

I noticed Dackel is used to handle everything from creating tasks to handling errors but I do think it will be easier to debug if you can extract the functionalities into different classes. I suggest having a parser class to parse strings to split up the task creation instead of letting Dackel handle everything.

Overall, I like the personalization of DACKEL.

The code in this PR is of an overall good standard, even though there are several places where it could be improved. I commented on several coding standard violations, most of which are due to missing Javadoc comments. It would also be good to review the imports used in each of the classes to see whether they are unused.

The codebase is exceptionally well-organized, demonstrating a strong adherence to Object-Oriented Programming principles and naming conventions. This review aims to provide constructive feedback to further refine and enhance the codebase, despite its already high quality.

Strengths
Adherence to OOP Principles: The code excellently utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making the system flexible and scalable. The use of interfaces and abstract classes promotes loose coupling and high cohesion across modules.

Naming Conventions and Readability: The naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables are meticulously followed, enhancing code readability and maintainability. It's clear that thoughtful consideration was put into naming, making it easy to understand the purpose and functionality of different parts of the codebase.

Code Structure and Organization: The project's structure is logical and well-organized, facilitating easy navigation through the codebase. The separation of concerns is evident, with distinct layers for data access, business logic, and user interface components.

Documentation and Comments: The documentation is comprehensive and concise, providing valuable insights into the design decisions and functionality of various components. Inline comments are judiciously used, adding clarity to complex logic without cluttering the code.

Testing and Reliability: The comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests demonstrates a commitment to reliability and quality assurance. Tests are well-written and cover a broad spectrum of scenarios, ensuring that the code behaves as expected under various conditions.

Code Review
General Impressions
Firstly, I would like to commend the effort and quality put into the development of the project. The code is well-structured, readable, and demonstrates a good understanding of the problem domain. It's evident that a significant amount of work has been dedicated to ensuring the logic is correct and efficient, which is greatly appreciated.

Strengths
Readability: The code is very readable, with clear naming conventions and concise functions that effectively encapsulate their intended functionality.
Efficiency: The logic of the main class is well structured and easily understood with a proper taskflow during proper execution.

Areas for Improvement
While the codebase is well-written and effective, there are several areas where we can improve, especially considering the project's delay and the non-OOP structure.

Refactoring to OOP: Refactoring the codebase to use an Object-Oriented approach could enhance its scalability and maintainability. OOP can help encapsulate related functionalities into classes, making the code more modular, easier to understand, and adapt to future requirements. This transition can be gradual, starting with core components that would benefit most from encapsulation and inheritance.

Modularization: Even without a full transition to OOP, increasing modularity could improve the code's organization. Breaking down the code into more discrete, independent modules or functions can facilitate parallel development and make it easier to manage complexity as the project grows.

Automated Testing: Implementing automated tests, if not already in place, can significantly speed up the development cycle by catching bugs early and reducing manual testing time. This could help in catching up with the deadlines.

Conclusion
Overall, the codebase is in an excellent state. The recommendations provided aim to build on the solid foundation already established, with a focus on ensuring the project can scale and adapt to future needs while addressing the current challenge of being behind schedule. Transitioning towards more OOP practices and enhancing modularity will be key steps in this process.

Great job on the iP thus far, it seems like you have covered the tasks needed. Overall no complaints about coding standards. You have added javadocs, named your variables correctly, organised your files in a manner that is noticeably consistent (and is hence readable in quite a quick fashion because I know where to look), and the names of the classes are also well named and as a result self explanatory!

Hi! So sorry that my review is this late. I think your coding standards are overall on very high quality, I especially like how descriptive the JavaDocs is. I also like this lambda switch expression, but I think it's only available from Java 12 onwards. So I don't think we can use it in Java 11, as much as I like it ;(

This is a super sound project. I like the way you have extensive error checks including SQLException really adds a whole new layer of depth to your project. You can try to remove some unnecessary empty lines in your method bodies to prevent your code from scaling too large. Other than that, solid effort keep it up!

Overall, very well done, excellent adherence to coding standards. 
I like how the commands area split into different classes and they inherit from the `Command` class. 
I like the fact that JavaDocs are provided for each class and method.

I think a better naming convention would be to replace `split` with a plural form of a noun, perhaps something like `segments`.

Your choice of names throughout the codebase is consistent and easy to understand, which is awesome for anyone reading your code. Maybe adding some comments for your methods and classes would be more helpful? Generally, I like how your code is nicely organized into packages, making it a breeze to find what you need.

Here the `description` means the whole part following the command type, while in the Task class another `description` means solely the description part of a task, which would be a little misleading or ambiguous. Would it be better to change the variable name here?
