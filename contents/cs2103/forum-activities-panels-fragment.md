The way I thought about the tasks is that todo is the most basic type of task and deadline is just a todo (with a date to finish by) and event is just a todo (with a start and end date)

Bcoz of this, I designed my code with 3 classes
Todo, Deadline (extends todo) and event (extends Todo)

However I was reading all the levels again from the beginning and noticed in level 4 that there should be a task class and Todo, Deadline and event should extend from Task instead.

Is is ok for me to leave it as it is? Or do I need to refactor my code completely for this

@damithc prof, referring to Q1, we are not sure if we can fix it because

*  it could be argued that its technicaly not wrong to have a date on the weight graph when theres no weight associated with that date. 

* But on the other hand, if we removed the weight, there is no point keeping a random date value in the weight graph.

i think,
* `Watcher` objects are stored as a variable in `Activity` so there has to be an association line from `Watcher` -&gt; `Activity`
* If there is already an association line, there is no need to show another dependency line from `Watcher` -&gt; `Activity`
* `Activity` directly accesses a constant in `ProgressWatcher` but there is no association between them, so we show it as a dependency

since it is clearly stated that Tasks are a **part** of an Action, this is a **whole-part** relationship, therefore composition.

It is not stated for history, so we cannot assume that it is composition.

4. Let’s say that in a class diagram, we have a class B which inherits an abstract method foo() from an abstract class A. IF this class B omits the method foo(), is the class diagram still valid? Main concern here is that since we omit foo() in the inherited concrete class, we might be omitting details like whether the function is abstract or concrete in the concrete class. 
   - Or can we just assume that since B is a concrete class, the abstract method is also a concrete method

Right now due to time constraints, my team is skipping refactoring and just adding code on top of existing one.

I'm still quite unsure about what I can and cannot do in UML diagrams, so please forgive the amount of questions I have here. If there are any answers to questions available on the CS2103 site or quizzes, please just let me know where to look for the answers. 

### General
1. If A and B, 2 classes in a system, both use the same database object to query data. Is that considered coupling?

### Sequence Diagrams
1. For alt paths, does the order of the partition matter? Are the executed in a waterfall manner like an actual if-else block?

**Long question**
In Quiz 8 Part 1, Q 21, there seems to are 2 valid interpretations of the following code
```java
Man m = new Man()
m.set(new Dog());
```
There seem to be 2 different interpretations of this creation. Are both valid?
1. You create the object and then pass it into the function
3. Inside the function, you create the object.
So my question here is that, in sequence diagrams, can there be multiple valid interpretations to the same code?

---


### Class & Object Diagrams
1. Is it okay to represent dependencies as dashed lines without any arrows, just like how class diagrams often have solid lines without navigabilities?
3. If we don't declare a visibility for a method or attribute, are they by default public? Or is that just unique to interfaces? What is the default visibility?
4. Is an abstract declaration still valid if ``{``abstract``}`` is not italicised but the text is not red? This question extends to the other headers like <<enumeration>> and <<interface>
5. In an abstract class, is it wrong to omit the ``{``abstract``{`` modifier for the print() class in the below image?
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/56617918/8a15722a-edec-4049-9322-a167e5815847)
6. For attribute associations, if a list is initialised to an empty list at the start, does it have a default value? 
   1. If so, how do we show it?
   2. If no, then is showing default value optional? Does this extend to all attributes?
7. Does enumeration headers need to be bolded?
8. Can association roles and association labels appear on the same association at the same time?
9. In a class diagram, can we represent our associations as lines for some classes, and associations as attributes for other classes such that associations are not used as both lines and attributes at the same time. Is this valid?
10. Is an object diagram valid if there are associations between objects, but no navigability or association roles is denoted?

Hi all, I made some changes to the tP, but GitHub actions fail because tests are for some reason not covered. For classes that I created, I understand.

So my question here is, do we need to create the test files for files like CommandBox if those don't exist yet?

Hi, I would like to ask for advice on whether or not my code needs MoreOOP. Not asking for a code review, just want to get a brief sensing. I have the following classes:

1. TaskManager - Similar to TaskList, manages the entire command line parsing, as well as CRUD of tasks 
2. Database - Similar to Storage, manages the data access layer, but also FileUtils, and DAO classes to help with the data management
3. StringUtils - Similar to Parser, as well as the individual Dao classes which has a getFrom() method which converts String input into model objects
4. UIManager - Similar to UI, it essentially is called whenever an operation is made, e.g. delete, list and is only used to print out UI

Are these sufficient enough to pass MoreOOP?

Similarly, if I already organise my files into separate folders, e.g. Enums, Dao, Utils, am I considered to have passed this?

I am thinking about using enums for commands, but I realised that this would require a refactor as all my functions that take in a command expect a type String. I have a few ways to approach this, but I'm not sure if this is very much worth the refactor
1. Refactor all functions to accept enum of Commands - But this would limit the helper function to only be able to accept Commands enum which I don't think is very extensible
2. Call Commands.LIST.getCommand() where getCommand() is a function to convert the enum to string - I don't really like this syntax because it breaks the purpose of the enum

Is it worth refactoring to use enums?

1. I think that for best practices, avoid integrating the entire thing at once and integrate module by module first. Doing so would allow you to isolate any possible issues and debug that particular module first.

> Hi @tankh99, I too am inclined towards keeping them in the same file for consideration of code complexity and potential points of failure. Since we will have to perform more file IO operations, I thought that multiple files may give rise to a situation whereby data is desynchronized if say one of three write operations fail. Suppose it is the last write operation that failed, I'd then have decide if I should undo the previous two writes. Also if new types of tasks were required in future it might be harder to refactor.

Regarding this, I don't believe there are multiple write operations are required by the iP right now? 

But I do see where you're coming from. It's a more personal choice to not want to customise the application specifically just for tasks, which are related to each other. In case other models that don't inherit from tasks also need to be added in the application, it is okay to refactor

I had the exact same implementation where I made multiple class files which implemented purely static helper functions. 

My opinion is that creating instanced classes are useful when you want to keep state specific to that class. Such as if you have a Storage class, maybe when you instance it, you pass in the path to the file so that in future, you don't have to pass in the file path again if you want to reuse the function. But for stuff like Parser, I don't see much point to not using static. That's only my opinion

> I would suggest exploring an option where entering an incomplete command, or maybe the command only without the parameters ask for the arguments one by one. And also at the same time allow you to include all the arguments at the same time too

This was exactly what I had in mind. In my opinion, this shouldn't be slower. A user can type it just as fast as the usual approach, if not even faster for 2 main reasons:
1. They don't have to stop and remember what were the input arguments
2. The method is less prone to errors. And if you fail, the error fails only for a specific section of the command and you don't have to retype everything

> There is no default visibility in UML, even for interfaces. If not shown, it means _unknown_. But in Java, interface members are implicitly public (no other choice). So, it doesn't matter if you show `+` or not for interface members in a UML diagram. They are already _known_ to be public.

However, what about normal classes? Are attributes/functions without any declared visibility by default package-private?

I understand that there's no default visibility in UML class diagrams, but what if we were designing a class diagram for a Java application? 

You previously mentioned that interface methods are public by default in Java. Then does the default visibility for normal classes also follow the behaviour of Java classes, which is to make methods like
```java
void sayHello() ``{``...``}``
```
as package-private?

So in a class diagram if there's a method like `sayHello()` without any visibility behaviour, is it still considered unknown? Or is it considered as package-private (~)?

Thanks @damithc for clarifying. Correct me if I'm wrong, but what I'm understanding here is that in the context of Java class diagrams, classes should always have their visibilities declared, otherwise the class diagram is invalid.

> 
> @tankh99 Did you mean _UML class diagrams for Java programs should always show visibility_? That's not correct. Showing visibility is optional. For example, both options A1 and A2 in my previous post are valid. It's just that A1 shows less information than A2.

Apologies for getting it wrong. Yes, I was referring to UML Class diagrams for Java programs. So I realise that showing visibility in class diagrams is optional. And that we cannot assume visibility for classes in class diagrams. But why can we assume so for interfaces?

Since Java 9, interface methods can be private, so we could have something like
```java
interface Flyable ``{``
  private void fly();
``}``
```

And in our class diagrams, we have

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Flyable ``{``
    <<interface>>
    fly()
  ``}``

```

> Yes, recent Java versions added other very Java specific features such as default methods, and the ability to include private methods for internal use within the interface. But in the UML discussion we were focusing on regular interface methods i.e., the abstract methods that makes up the _interface_. Those cannot be private. Making them private would break the concept of an interface, as an interface is something you expose to the outside world, for other classes to implement or rely on. If you want to show those Java-specific private methods in a UML diagram (which is unlikely to be useful, as they are for internal use within the interface), you should show the visibility of all methods so that there is no ambiguity.

Ahhh, I understand now! I was confused because I was wondering why we could assume visibility for interfaces but not classes. But this resolves it. Thanks so much for your patience Prof!

Because the more coupled components are, the more likely it is to suffer from regressions as you add more code, since with highly coupled components, changing one thing may negatively impact the other coupled thing.

Thank you @E0735389. From what I now understand, it's that the system that we're modelling itself should not be part of the use case system. And even then, its use case interactions would be too granular to be meaningfully modelled in a use case diagram.

The prior 2 assertions were assumptions made based on some things that the textbook mentioned. Also, my use of "immediately" is probably incorrect, I meant to say "provide solutions sooner rather than later".

For the 1st assertion about providing solutions sooner. I interpreted "delivering the software as you need it" as being able to provide solutions quickly. Though, I'm not exactly sure what "far into the future" is trying to compare against. Is it comparing itself against SCRUM?

E.g. if the program has a feature to "open help window to show usage information for this command", but there are some **factual error** in the explanation, would that be a DocumentationBug or a FunctionalityBug?

In the textbook:

> For example, finding half of the bugs of that product or 4 bugs, whichever the lower, could earn you full marks.

Isn't this really low? Or does "could" mean "in some situation" such as "they're all `priority.High` and all correctly categorized"?

------

Speaking of which, regarding this part:

> You may report grammar issues as bugs but note that minor grammar issues that don't hinder the reader are allowed to be categorized as response.NotInScope (by the receiving team) -- such bugs earn only small amount or credit for the tester (hence, do not waste time reporting too many minor grammar errors).

If they adds up linearly (e.g. 5 NotInScope = 1 severity.Low, I don't know the grading criteria) wouldn't it still be beneficial?

For example if it takes on average 2 minutes to find and report a grammar bug, and 11 minutes to find and report a severity.Low bug, it would be beneficial to report grammar bug, isn't it?

Reason: CATcher and GitHub strips out content wrapped in &lt; and >, for security reasons.

While this is technically correct, it's not very accurate e.g. if the user want to type `&lt;` wrapped in backticks i.e. inline quotes, then verbatim `&lt;` must be used.

Currently, I want to make a common superclass for `CommandExecutionException` (which happens when a command is executed, renamed from `CommandException` in AB3) and `ParseException` (which happens when a command is parsed). The purpose is to make a method `getErroneousCommandPart()` method to be available on them.

Unfortunately, this is impossible because `ParseException` already inherits from `IllegalValueException`, and Java does not allow diamond inheritance. Making it no longer inherit from `IllegalValueException` would break API compatibility, and of course it doesn't make sense to make either `CommandException` or `IllegalValueException` to inherit from the other.

I come up with the following workaround:

* make `CommandException` an interface.
* unfortunately, this does not allow writing `catch(CommandException e)` instead of `catch(ParseException | CommandException e)`, or `public void f() throws CommandException` instead of `public void f() throws ParseException, CommandException` etc.
* furthermore, I cannot provide a private field for `CommandException` like `private final CommandPart erroneousCommandPart;`

So,

* Is this a good workaround?
* Is there any other alternative?
* The problem is that nothing in the interface guarantees that classes inherit it must also inherit `Exception`. Is there a good option for this?

Note that update to version of PlantUML can also modify the image, but we most likely don't want to regenerate the png in that case, especially when the version of PlantUML on different developers' version can be different.

The feature branches workflow: a reasonable alternative, but if you choose this, make sure your master branch is protected and most members have write access only (i.e., no admin access)
The centralized workflow: discouraged.
Even if you do switch, we still recommend that you use PR reviews, at least for PRs affecting others' features.

Context: #575.

Suppose the problem is the following:

* a team member takes some task
* sends a pull request
* I point out some bugs in the implementation
* the team member can fix the bug, but will takes a very long time

Is it recommended to **merge the feature anyway, and deal with the bug in a future pull request**?

I think:

* Advantage: Reduce the chance of merge conflict later on.
* Disadvantage: Increases the number of bugs that must be fixed, which would cause problem if not fixed by the strict deadline.
* What if the pull request furthermore fails the tests/makes the tests not compile?

where

```

and `PREFIX_NAME` is outright imported from the real code by `import static seedu.address.logic.parser.CliSyntax.PREFIX_NAME;`.

The point of tests is to ensure that the main code does not have bugs. To do that, we want the tests to not have bugs as well.

However, it appears to me that the more complicated-looking the tests are, the more likely they are to have a hidden bug and/or test the wrong thing.
Why don't we directly hard code the string that consists of the test into the test code? That would reduce the probability of accidentally testing the wrong thing.

* Looking at the requirements of writing a feature specification https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/admin/tp-w6.html#2-draft-the-feature-specification, it feels like copying AB3 user guide would satisfy the condition, if I understood correctly?

  However, I think a difference is that AB3 user guide does not contain e.g. the exact error message when a command fails.

Besides, I don't really understand what this feature list is supposed to be, since the features is mostly a subset of existing AB3 features --- if I understood correctly, "_complete_ detailed description" means we should still explain what the command do even though AB3 already does it.

So,
* if we copy down the exact feature set of AB3, would we have nothing to do to implement v1.2?
* are we allowed to specify less than the whole feature set of AB3 (in which case, after v1.2 is completed, I assume that the resulting product will have to have all the features in the union of existing features and feature specification?)

There are some other points where it's inconsistent, although I'm not sure what is the guideline, or if either way is fine.

1. in the textbook in https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#c-to-java-junit-junit-basic there is a line

```
	there is final punctuation.

2. Comparing the two example above, we see that in one case, the "if" is capitalized, while in the other it's not capitalized.
3. Meanwhile, in the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments):

If I go to one of your commits https://github.com/bgopi23/ip/commit/ed097c1aab108c8f1e686d7f88bac6d8435f9497 , I don't see any warning. Neither does visiting any commit in your tags page https://github.com/bgopi23/ip/tags .

While that method works, it makes the source code excessively long (besides the obvious problem that it won't work when `$SCRIPT_DIR` contains any space). Easier way is to just `cd` into the directory at the start of the script:

```
cd -- "$( dirname -- "$``{``BASH_SOURCE[0]``}``" )"
```

Assuming the script is *executed* and not *sourced* (otherwise the `cd` will affect the bash shell as well, but this can be easily)

I decide to look up the Java specification. https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se17/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.1.4 The formal term used is "subclass" instead of "descendant", and it indeed only consider strict subclass.

Regarding this point:

> You may remove existing features if they are not relevant to the final version of your product, although most existing features are expected to stay in some form or other.

Let's say that we don't include `find` in v1.2 feature specification or user guide, but with the caveat that if the user "accidentally" type it in then the program "somewhat" works (but might have slightly buggy behavior because the command was originally written for AB3). Would this be a problem?

(Or are we expected to remove it completely? Then how will we add it back in v1.3? Do we need to?)

------

> Yes, you may copy parts of AB3 UG that is relevant to your v1.2

Should we copy it, or should we just say "the feature is the same as explained in the user guide of AB3"?
E.g. this part could potentially be copied:

> :information_source: Notes about the command format:
> 
> Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> e.g. in add n/NAME, NAME is a parameter which can be used as add n/John Doe.
> 
> Items in square brackets are optional.
> e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as n/John Doe t/friend or as n/John Doe.
> 
> Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
> e.g. [t/TAG]…​ can be used as   (i.e. 0 times), t/friend, t/friend t/family etc.
> 
> Parameters can be in any order.
> e.g. if the command specifies n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER, p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME is also acceptable.
> 
> Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as help, list, exit and clear) will be ignored.
> e.g. if the command specifies help 123, it will be interpreted as help.

or the part that validates email address:

> Emails should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
> 1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
> 2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
>   The domain name must:
>     - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
>     - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
>     - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

First, as you know how git works, the commit history is not linear. Rather, it's a tree-like structure.

`git log` or similar tools, however, list the commits chronologically, so it's normal that the commits appear interleaved.

Usually, `git merge` is intelligent enough to correctly apply the patches. The rest you have to resolve manually. That's just the normal merge conflict resolution process.

You can certainly undo the sync fork feature if it gets too difficult. You can do the following:

* use `git reflog` to find the previous commit id. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28932515/how-to-unmerge-a-git-merge
* `git reset --hard` to set the branch back to that commit id.

But because it's desirable for you to apply the new change anyway, assume the current tree structure is:

```
  --- B
 /
A
 \
  --- C
```
your branch is C, your friend's branch is B. Then do `git diff A C` to see all the developments you made, `git reset --hard B` to move to the merged upstream/master, then manually reapply the changes.

Personally I'd say 10001 is "common sense" enough. You **don't** want to spend time in your job typing out 10001 lines for the enum (remember that in Java you have to type out all the enum values and it must reside in the source code), and of course such code won't get approved.

That said, "can take only a small number of finite values" feel like an incorrect explanation. The common sense explanation would be "use enum when the names are meaningful, and use integer when the integer value is meaningful". 

E.g. even if you assume "each person can have at most 3 children", it would not make much sense to create `enum NumberOfChildren ``{`` ZERO, ONE, TWO, THREE ``}``;` since if you want to add one children you need to switch-case it.

In particular, always use enum for nominal types, and don't use enum for interval/ratio types. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement)

------

Technically in Python you can dynamically generate an enum with a large number of values. But at the moment I can't think of a valid use case, since `__getattr__` exists anyway.

If I understood correctly,
* it's not true that you should put **a** system as an actor, it is just that you should not put the system that is *the software you're developing itself* as an actor. If you're developing an API, then "automated scripts interacting with the API" might as well be an actor.
* the intention is that the things described in use case diagrams describes *high level* interactions (i.e. one bubble represents a whole use case). So an action like "system notifies user of new messages" would be too granular, since often the next action in the use case would be "user check new messages" or "user discard the notification".

The "none of the alternative" means: "It is possible to omit the `else` block".

For example, if `a` is an integer, it is possible for an `alt` frame to have `[a==1]` and `[a==2]`, without `[else]`.

My idea is to create a main branch to update this command, but I have many issues to solve such as changing AddressBookParser, creating new classes and so on. From what I have seen, we should have a individual branch for each issue (or should we be doing this), or is it ok to close all issues with one branch? Cons of one branch each is risk of merge conflicts and lacking ability to integration test properly as without new classes there is no point in updating parser.

My alternative idea is as we go on, we create a branch from our feature branch we are working on and merge as we go on but this is not taught so I am assuming is a bad practice.

It seems that this is actually a flaw and could weigh badly in grading. So I was wondering, if such sequential input is considered 'slow typing' as compared to a single line input where we have "add &lt;name> &lt;address> " and hence be considered a flaw?

I am a bit confused about the steps here, I have created two PRs, one for Coding Quality and another for Assertions.

I merged Coding Quality PR and pulled my master and created a new commit (not the fast forward option). Step 3 says unmerged branches are no longer in sync, what are these unmerged branches? Is that not normal when we have updated our master? (I have yet to merge my Assertions PR).

'merge the master branch to each of them', usually we merge branch to master, now we switch to another branch and merge master to them? Are we referring to the branches we created up to this point from Week 2?

Also, why is there a push notification, when our master should be the same as upstream master? (Since we just pulled from upstream) (Im assuming this is because I didnt fast forward, is this not recommended) ?

Thanks

try catch imo shouldnt really be a control flow thing (correct me if im wrong) so I think its best to print the exception's message if caught and not do any operations?

If im not wrong, you are trying to load the filepath so check if exists and perform operations first and if exception still occurs raise this to the user.

The more I think about it, I get confused haha. By definition there is no cyclical link, so for your question, I think its possible if we are not referring to them as in Parent-Child cyclical relationship. Chapter can have book field but the same book can have multiple chapter fields but may not necessarily refer in a parent-child relationship.

Suppose this from the tutorial, composition by definition cannot have cyclical links but here it is implied Category is made out of possibly several books, but each book can be made up of several chapters.

For above I think below code represents it..,

```ruby
class Chapter ``{``
    #Signals composition, there is deletion effect as well
    public Book[] listOfBooks = new Book[5];
    
``}``


class Book ``{``
    #Nothing to do with composition relationship. Just that this book has many chapters.
    public Chapter[] listOfChapters = new Chapter[10];
``}``
```

If anyone can weigh in on what is meant by cyclical, that would be great!

Thank you so much, will take note of the (many) mistakes I made here

For the merging to unmerged branches, I may have done this wrongly by not merging to the unsync branches (branch-A-Assertion) in this case and merging through the PR directly. I resolved my merge conflicts through the online merge conflict tool on GitHub. I was wondering if this is considered a bad practice as compared to 

_**"Yes, switch to , branch-A-Assertions and merge the master branch to it. That way, the latest code from the master branch will be added to that branch, making it in-sync with the master branch."**_ first which I assume will allow me to resolve merge conflicts locally first instead of on the fork as I may have done wrongly.

I think the 'none of the altenative' isnt specific to the picture, the `else` could be some other condition. Here I believe at least one of the path must be executed, since there is no opt.

Sorry to be clearer,

Suppose this team has a DG enhancement that allows for symbols in fields in future which is fine. But in one enhancement they have included `NAME`,  `EMAIL`, `TAG` for example.

I flagged this as overlapping fields as three different code changes have to be made to allow for symbols in these different fields, hence each of it should be in its own enhancement.

Hence, by using one overlapping enhancement they prevented me from flagging feature flaws in all three fields which would each be a `severity.Low` `FeatureFlaw`.

If I am not wrong, the team should have made enhancement for just one FIELD, such as `NAME`. This is fairer and I will be able to flag out `TAG` and `EMAIL` for not allowing symbols which is a FF.

Due to this possible overlap, is this considered medium due to the number of issues it possibly prevented testers from flagging out?

Thanks

It was just mentioned for their enhancement that,

"The system currently does not support special characters like ‘-’ and ‘/’ in names, tags and assignment details. The enhancement will add support for these characters, allowing for more diverse names, tags and detailed descriptions."

I believe giving them benefit of doubt might be reaching as they may wish to add three different parsing-related enhancements here

Hi, I have a these following few questions to clarify:

1. Understand that parameters of method can be included: `add(X)`, but is it WRONG to not have it?
2. It is ok to show the return type of methods: `getItemCount():int`, however if the method is void, will it be represented as such `count():void`
3. ON the same note as 2, if shown in the exams that some methods show the return type, but some methods never show in teh same diagram: `add():int, minus():int, multiply() `, will this be considered as wrong? (if let say we have to decide if such class/object diagrams with such methods show are correct or not)

1. Am I able to use my hand-written notes (e.g. notes on activity diagrams, sequence diagrams etc) while doing the PE? 
2. Would it be a hard timing for each phases of testing, when the first 1 hour is reached, the invigilator will ask us to stop doing product testing and move to the evaluation of documents etc?

Hi, I have already implemented the GUI as per branch-10 but it is still red under my IP progress for Level-10, may I know how else can I do to clear this portion?

Context:
I have a functional GUI but I have not really edited other UI aspects of the GUI yet (e.g. my text box may be too small for my text etc), could this be a reason?

Hi all, the current query I have now is that I am unable to see the link between the bot and the UI. Let me provide the context followed by my question. 

[Context] So in my bot java file, I have a `main()` method which builds an instance of my bot and calls the `run()`, which triggers the series of events within my `run()` method such as reading in the user's input, parsing and making sense of them and print the according response.

[Question] So with the GUI involved now, do I move the logic of my `run()` method into my 'getResponse(String input)' (as per part 4 of the GUI tutorial) and remove the original `run()` method? 

[Question 2] I don't really see how the `main()` method in my bot java file is being run since the Launcher class will run the Main.java file (as per part 4 of the GUI tutorial) which instantiates an instance of my bot WITH the empty constructor (as per the part 1 of the GUI tutorial). If that is the case, the original constructor of the bot class (which requires the passing in of the file path, as per the guidance from A-OOP) would never be called, then how does the application run?

Hi prof @damithc to answer your question, nope its not just changes to the UG because if we add in the UG "`email` field only accepts certain domain name", but if the user keys an inaccurate domain name, my app will still perform the command as it was not implemented earlier to detect incorrect domain name. So this is considered a feature flaw I suppose so are we able to amend our code to ensure that domain name HAVE to be correct?

Thank you for the clarification prof! So if that is the case, setting our 'defence' by asking users to input the correct email domain in our UG would suffice right since we are not allowed to have these enhancements?

Sorry but what I dont get for question 4 is that from a class diagrams (like the one in tutorial), when we are needed to draw an object diagram, do we redraw the object diagram from scratch or shall we follow what was drawn in the class diagram already but we modify some things (like in the tutorial question, we omit the drawing of Item object beacuse the StockItem is already an Item, and Inventory object can jsut point directly to StockItem instead). So yeah i was just wondering if there are tricks to drawing object diagrams from a question in general

Hi, I received an email last night about PPP submissions, alongside the other file naming conventions I was supposed to adhere to for the tP submissions.

I saw that the PPP had to follow a file naming format and was supposed to be submitted on Canvas, but I see no dedicated assignment submission page for the PPP.

Is this because we are supposed to submit it along with the tP deliverables in the same submission?

In addition, upon referring to the [link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week13/project.html) provided in the email about more details regarding submissions, it is stated that PDF submission is not required, despite the email instructing us to save the PPP in the form of a PDF format for Canvas.

I was trying to set up checkstyle while attempting A-Gradle, and I tried to set it up in the `gradle.build` file, and ensured that both the `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml` files were in `./config/checkstyle` and they were copied over from the address book 3 repo, I also followed the guide provided on [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html).

I even referred to previous iterations of the forums and saw their threads, but it did not help.

Trying to run `./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` gives me the following error:

``` shell
Execution failed for task ':checkstyleMain'.
> A failure occurred while executing org.gradle.api.plugins.quality.internal.CheckstyleAction
   > An unexpected error occurred configuring and executing Checkstyle.
      > Unable to create Root Module: config ``{``/Users/kennethseet/Desktop/CS2103/ip/config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml``}``, classpath ``{``null``}``.

```

Trying to configure checkstyle on IntelliJ gives me this error:

I would push my code to my forked repo, but running `./gradlew build` fails,  giving me an error similar to when I run `./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest`. 

Running ` ./gradlew checkstyleMain --stacktrace 2>&1 | grep Caused` helped me isolate it to the following errors, which lead me to think that it might be caused by the checkstyle script.

```shell

Should this be standard practice? Also, will it affect the grading of my iP?

I was also pretty stumped by the jargon in the question at first, and I had to type out the classes to visualise what the sentence was trying to illustrate.

Suppose you have an is-a relationship between where the Task object is the parent class with the method `execute()`, with its child class having an implementation of `execute()` which overrides the parent's implementation, for example.

``` java
// Task is the type of object seen at compile time
public class Task ``{``
    // ...
    // constructors and attributes omitted for brevity

    // This is the original implementation of execute as seen at compile time, and also the overridden method
    public void execute() ``{``
        System.out.println("Executing task...")
    ``}``
``}``

// Example is the "actual type of object" seen at run time
class Example extends Task ``{``
    // ...
    // constructors and attributes omitted for brevity

    // This is the "implementation in the actual type of object", which is what is resolved to by dynamic binding.
    @Override
    public void execute() ``{``
        System.out.println("Executing task...");
    ``}``
``}``

public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
    Task t = new Example();
    t.execute(); // compiler thinks it prints "Executing task", but actually resolves to execute() in the Example class
``}``
```

I would suggest abstracting the input functionality to a different class, for example Input.java which handles functionality that parses the input.

My solution to the problem was to model the parsing of the input within the class of the chatbot, as the chatbot object would be expected to have the functionality to listen and parse input.

However, I created a main driver class which runs the simulation, and turned Duke.java into its own object with its own functionalities. 

Hope this helped solve your problem!

Personally, I felt like gracefully catching the error and providing the user with feedback instead of terminating gives the user the best experience, as it would prevent the user from having to restart the program again. 

In addition, it would also serve as good practice with exception handling for the tP.

It depends on the user experience you want the user to have, for e.g if you feel making commands case insensitive provides a more seamless experience for users, you can go ahead with that approach.

Other examples I can think of are commands with /from and /to and /by for events and deadlines respectively being useful for users to know if they are explicitly specifying a deadline or event duration, but others may feel that it is obstructive and not very convenient for the user.

Hope I helped!

For your second question, remember to override the `Object::equals()` method in order to make your test pass, if you are comparing two objects which have the same attributes but have a different hash. This is because `assertEquals()` uses the `.equals()` method to compare the two objects.

My bad, didn't realise you already tried #208.

I tried pulling your code and running your project, and it looks pretty nice on my end. Nice work!

I refactored some of your code in ListCommand::execute(), and I think I fixed the problem (not for the case where a specific date is indicated though.)

I believe this is your desired output:
<img width="484" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-08 at 3 56 30 PM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/120318851/7d1ae663-c719-480d-a207-edeb624f46e1">
 
I refactored the section of your code which handled the case where no date was specified, by only appending a newline character if it was not the last task in the task list, which solved the problem.

Here's the relevant code snippet:
```java
//...
            ``}`` else if (i != tasks.size()) ``{``
                sb.append(String.format("\t%d. %s\n", i, tasks.get(i - 1)));
                count++;
            ``}`` else ``{``
                sb.append(String.format("\t%d. %s", i, tasks.get(i - 1)));
                count++;
            ``}``
//...
```
As for why the \n character causes the three dots to appear at the bottom, I'm not really sure, but removing the newline character at the end of the message seems to be a quick fix.
Hope I helped!

```java
        if (input.trim().equals("bye") || input.trim().equals("bb")) ``{``

I think you mean column instead of row.
Firstly, the naming of the class describes an object that checks the limit, which is a noun, `LimitChecker`, whereas `CheckLimit` is a verb and is an improper name to give a Java object.

Secondly, the naming of the method in the second column, `calculate()` is a verb which describes what the method does, whereas `result()` is a noun, which does not accurately describe what the method does.

My team had a similar issue, and we took this as a precedent for it.

Our line of argument centered around how it is rare for a user to open multiple instances of the application, how the application still retains the latest changes made to the application, which should be the expected behaviour.

Failing that, arguing it as a low severity documentation bug is reasonable.

Context: Someone I know was having issue with getting the tests and build to pass. So how do I "send" them my changes.

Problem: I don't have write access to their repo, neither do I want the commit be under my name. But I want to help them and send them the necessary changes so we can move along. I am familiar with `git stash` so I was wondering if I can "send my stash" to them.

Turns out you can!

Basically it turns the $\Delta$ (diff) between the repo in 2 different point in time (between commits, stashes etc), and git can then use this $\Delta$ to apply the changes.  
  
1. Checkout their repo / branch / whatever
2. Make your changes
3. This part can vary but for simplicity I just use `git stash` to store the changes in a stack.
4. Turn it into a patch file by `git stash show -p`
  1. On Linux / Unix / MacOS: `git stash show -p > note-fix.patch`
  2. On windows (careful of Encoding issues): `git stash show -p | Set-content -Encoding utf8 note-fix.patch`
5. Send the patch file to them
6. They see the stats with `git apply --stat note-fix.patch` (basically shows the diff in a normal git status)
7. Confirm? Apply with `git apply note-fix.patch`
8. Push!

My PR: https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/26

Description:

Changing prefix to "--tags " instead of "t/" no longer allow input to only have the parameters. 
See https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/pull/26/files#
>  src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/CliSyntax.java

Previously: `"add n/Etc t/"` (OK)  
Now: `"add --name etc --tags "` (Fail)

What causes this change in behavior? I am expecting that a change in prefix shouldn't result in a change in that as well

This result in test in `AddressBookParserTest` failing
PersonBuilder generates an empty Tag Set
"--tags " doesn't work with empty tags
So getEditPersonDecriptor returns no --tags flag with an empty set
this breaks the test as the Tag Set is now null instead of EmptySet
but then the editPersonDescription will be different from the one from PersonBuilder
hence the build fails
Make the tag Set non-empty, so it will be forced to generate a tag flag
the tag in the command and so it can update it

<panel  header="**12. :fas-info-circle: Changing Parser in tP to use Apache Commons CLI Library**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/509" expanded>

## Library

[Apache Commons CLI](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/)

## Purpose

We want to explore potentially using this library to replace the parser in tP because the input format `p/(phone_number``}``` is not very verbose compared to CLI standards people are normally used to like `--phone ``{``phone number``}```. We also think it might be easier for development, abstraction. 

It is currently a hypothetical thought process, can we specify in NFR like parser library must be third party for example?

The Apache Commons CLI library provides an API for parsing command line options passed to programs. It's also able to print help messages detailing the options available for a command line tool.

Commons CLI supports different types of options:

- POSIX like options, for example `tar -zxvf foo.tar.gz`
- GNU like long options, for example `du --human-readable --max-depth=1`
- Java like properties, for example `java -Djava.awt.headless=true -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true Foo`
- Short options with value attached, for example `gcc -O2 foo.c`
- long options with single hyphen, for example `ant -projecthelp`

A typical help message displayed by Commons CLI looks like this:

```
usage: ls
 -A,--almost-all          do not list implied . and ..
 -a,--all                 do not hide entries starting with .
 -B,--ignore-backups      do not list implied entried ending with ~
 -b,--escape              print octal escapes for nongraphic characters
    --block-size <SIZE>   use SIZE-byte blocks
 -c                       with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                          modification of file status information) with
                          -l:show ctime and sort by name otherwise: sort
                          by ctime
 -C                       list entries by columns

For [`A-Assertions`](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week5/project.html#a-assertions)   
  
Can I assume that assertions will not be present in run time and there is no need to catch assertions?  
  
What is the difference with checking for edge cases with exceptions and handling them. Or it his a more fundamental issue   
e.g. We assume List.get should always return something so we can use an assert here, vs asserting that a user input is wrong which we use exceptions for instead  
  
As of now the GUI just hangs when an assert fails.  
  
Edit:
To add on, IntelliJ is saying that a of my assertions are 
```java
assert cmd != null : "Command is null, should never happen";
```
> Condition 'cmd != null' is always 'true'  
  
**if** my code is this "safe", is there a need to do an assertion?

After getting confused by what exactly tagging is, heres a simple foolproof-way to doing tagging for iP.  
  
A tag is basically a **bookmark**, it points to a specific commit.  
  
**Add the tag after committing**.   
  
So for example:  
```bash
# this is the commit that implements Level-1
git commit -m "``{``commit message``}``"
git tag -a Level-1 -m "``{``Message or comment for the tag, e.g. Implement Rename, Greet, Exit``}``"

# renaming a commit BEFORE PUSHING
git commit --amend

git push 
git push --tags # this uplaods the tags to GitHub
```

  
A commit can have multiple **tags** but a **tag** can only point to one commit.

Hope this help those who are lost with what are tags exactly.  

You also tag retrospectively, after you have already committed.

I think its depends on how your application is designed. Should `storage.load` _always_ return a tasklist?  
Should `storage.load` handle the errors within itself and _"fail gracefully"_ or should the error be passed up to `Victor` who decide what to do?  
For example within `storage.load` itself you can catch exceptions for File not existing, being unable to parse and load the Tasks or IO errors. 
  
Extending what @alfaloo said, for example `storage.load` can throw a custom subclass of DukeException, maybe like a `StorageLoadException` so you can 

```java
try ``{``
    ....
``}`` catch (StorageLoadException e) ``{``
    ... // do something
``}`` catch (InvalidParseException e) ``{``
  ... // do something else 
``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
  ... // do something else
``}``
```

@UdhayaShan1 
👍 😄 
Good point! Exceptions for control flows is something from _CS2030S_ (PTSD lol) and I don't think handling __edge cases__ is that bad of a "pattern".   
I think in this case it is fine, the alternative is to also have guard conditions; to ensure file is there, to ensure file format is valid.  
But if we do this we run into a problem with how do we tell the calling function that something Succeeded or not and we may end up having to use Monads ala [`Results (rust)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) [`Results (kotlin)`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-result/)  
  
According to the textbook:  
  
> In general, use exceptions only for 'unusual' conditions. Use normal return statements to pass control to the caller for conditions that are 'normal'.  
https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/errorHandling.html#error-handling 
  
Edit: 
TL;DR  
Depends on your separation of concern, error boundaries and what failure should do / means and how you want your software to respond to it.

> I had the exact same implementation where I made multiple class files which implemented purely static helper functions.
> 
> My opinion is that creating instanced classes are useful when you want to keep state specific to that class. Such as if you have a Storage class, maybe when you instance it, you pass in the path to the file so that in future, you don't have to pass in the file path again if you want to reuse the function. But for stuff like Parser, I don't see much point to not using static. That's only my opinion

I did the same thing in my application, everything except for the Tasks is static . . .   
  
Storage could be static as well considering theres only "one" database.  
Tasklist can be static as well if theres only "one" tasklist, thats how I see things hahaha.  
Ui could be static too...  
   
For example, `System.out` is `static` (you only have one standard out)  
  
  
I didn't see the point of instantiating an instance of the class as so far I have not needed any single instance yet.  
So in my design everything is mainly done through this `static` methods.  
  
Could also be possible to use [singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern).

One possible way is to think of the GUI as an extension of your UI. In a way the commands entered can still be passed to the inner "app". Just that its no longer doing prints to stdout.

I tried getting ChatGPT (GPT) 4 to generate some of my user guides and it was meh to good.  
What I did was pass in the few critical files (you can only upload 10) and it can infer from some of them what commands there are and the command format (I think there was a few data poisoning because one of the file already contain the built in help message with the format for the answers so I guess at worst its a format translation). Also discovered some _"markdown injection_ where it do not properly escape markdown code... but its md not html so I dont think its a security vuln.
I guess if I had more docs to write, ChatGPT would be better but I spent more time wrangling the format then writing it myself.  
  
It's more useful for answering JavaFXML questions because the documents on it are absolutely hard to understand.  
  
My take away:
I feel getting automated away is a really real concern. I keep up with the latest happenings in AI and LLMs. They are here to stay and I think its better to start getting used to working with them then burying one head in the sand and refusing to acknowledge their strengths and weaknesses.  
  
The most basic jobs can probably be automated, some of the more humans orientated stuff is probably here to stay, finding user stories (not writing but discovering what the user actually wants), working with stakeholders and etc. The best way is to have a conceptual understanding of what you are doing, you are the architect, AI can be the builders. But eventually one day they might be the architect too. 🤖 🏗️

If you are worried about MITM attacks. You can turn on HTTPS only mode in your browser.  
  
Alternatively if you are setting up your own website next time, enable HSTS.  
  
If you are making web applications next time, make sure a link to your website does put sensitive parameters in your query parameters.  
  
TBH I think this is both a "client" and "server" issue? No one is stopping you from enforcing HTTPS only? And the website does not server anything particularly "sensitive" either. If you want a higher level of confidentiality and privacy perhaps Github pages should not be used to host your website. . .
  
I could see the case if the user was able to trigger a request through query parameters or whatever, e.g.  
http://mysite/makeUser/?userName=XXX&Password=XXXX  
But this link does not do it. Its also bad practice to make this kind of URLs anyway. (This form of URLs are common in verification emails where they need the url to pass content to the server and it opens up a can of worms like CSRF)  
Then perhaps yes HTTPS should be used. But in this case, HTTPS does not really serve a purpose?

TL;DR I think its more a nitpick... I give it a  
CVE 0.1

Q2: Will we be penalized for feature flaws not fixed during the feature freeze?

A: Product design is hard, and achieving a very good design takes experience, skill, and multiple iterative refinements. Hence, having some feature flaws at this stage is natural. Accordingly, feature flaws will not be penalized In the following cases:

  - If the feature flaw will be fixed by an item you listed in the Planned enhancements DG section (as mentioned above).
  -  After the feature flaw is reported during the PE, you successfully argued it as 'not in scope' (i.e., fixing that flaw is of lower priority than the work done already, and hence it is justifiable to be postponed to a future version). Reporters of such bugs will earn partial credit.

In addition, you can mitigate the impact of feature flaws and thus lower its severity by tweaking the UG (e.g., explain the feature better, clearly state the limitations and guide users to work around those limitations)

Can I check with the teaching team if there is a discrepancy between the UG and the functionality of the code, should we update the UG or the code? For example, in our v1.3 UG we did not mention spaces are not allowed for tags and our examples have tags with spaces. However, when a tag with spaces is added, a message stating that "Tags can only contain alphanumeric characters" is shown. There are two ways to resolve this issue: we can either update the UG to explicitly mention that spaces are not allowed, or we can update the code for tag validation to allow spaces. I understand that its written in Q1 of the FAQ `If the current behavior differs from the UG but the current behavior is not strictly incorrect, update the UG to match the current behavior (in the interest of minimizing code changes). ` However, I am concerned that if I update only the UG, our tag feature disallowing spaces can be considered a feature flaw during the PE. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!

Hi can I check with the teaching team if I will be penalised for failing the Git Standard admin task (last 5 commit messages should not have easily detectable Git standard violations) on the IP tracker dashboard? I went through my past commits and I have identified the commit where I made the mistake, but I am not sure if I should amend it because that might change the date of the commit.

Hi Prof can I check if we are allowed to deviate slightly from our feature specification document (eg. deviating on attribute types)? At the same time, can I check if it is possible for features to be GUI related (eg. better data visualisation) instead of being command related? Lastly, can I check if we are allowed to seek a consultation with the teaching team to get a sanity check on the team's progress and whether the feature specification fulfills the TP constraints?

This may be a trivial question, but I would like to check if owners of the TP repo in the team organisation are required to fork the TP repo to their personal Github account as well. In addition, it was mentioned that we are allowed to switch to a lighter workflow after the first iteration. If the team is interested to switch over to the feature branch workflow after v1.2, does this mean we no longer use our TP forks, and every team member clones the TP repo in the team organisation instead?

Hi prof sorry to hijack this thread but I am facing a similar issue; I am unable to set the option to use Gradle from the "gradle-wrapper.properties file".
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/83827461/dd047aef-ed7b-439d-9438-02eba1ed6b55)
Even when I changed the Gradle JVM to Azul-11, when i run java --version on the terminal, it shows that the current Java runtime is Java 19. 
Can I check how can I resolve this issue?

Update: I downloaded JDK 11 from the following source [OpenLogicJDK](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=406&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All) instead of the official Oracle source [OracleJDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) because the Oracle website was down.

Thank you Prof for the response. Just to clarify, does that mean we are allowed to change the implementation of the features from what was stated in the feature specification later on? At the same time, for GUI related features, how should we write the feature specification, since there is no related command?

Lastly, my team is thinking of adding an email address field for a Person so that we can adapt the AB3 code for recruiters to contact candidates and manage the interview pipeline; can I check if this would be in line with the Evolve strategy? I am worried that our product might be viewed as going down the Morph route instead.

Thank you Prof for the response! Noted on the first two points.

> Doesn't it already have an email address field? Or did I misunderstand your question?

Yes I apologise for the mistake; I was referring to changing the validation rules for the email address to be stricter. In conjunction with this, can I check if adding features to allow recruiters (target audience) to keep track of interview status of candidates will be in line with the Evolve strategy, since we are no longer using AB3 as purely an addressbook? How do we tell the difference between the Evolve and Morph routes?

Thanks Prof for the response! However, as the deadline for submission is in an hour's time and I have already released the JAR file on Github with smoke testing, I was thinking the timing might be a bit tight to perform smoke testing on a JAR file.

I faced the same bug too; don't change the code to the one in issue #352. Either that, or you must refactor the unit tests to account for the change in the generateSuccessMessage method. For example, you can see in your log output that the expected person is a Person object, but the actual output is a String.

Hi Prof, thank you for the response. I noted in the week 7 workflow that we are allowed to start implementing v1.2 if we have time. To clarify again, does this mean express approval for us to start implementing features for v1.2 after v1.1 is done? At the same time, can I check again if we are allowed to merge in code from the RemarkCommand tutorial if it is relevant to our project while we are still in v1.1?

Hi prof to add on this point if we have added more features which cause existing tests to fail, do we need to rewrite the tests such that they pass? I was thinking we need to rewrite the tests until all pass, since checking for test success is conducted as part of CI/CD.

For this paragraph listed in Admin Weekly schedule → Deadline for weekly tasks:

> It's OK to make occasional mistakes in weekly tasks (making mistakes is a natural part of learning new things after all). If a weekly task was not accepted as 'done' due to a mistake you made, go ahead and rectify the mistake as soon as you can -- our grading scripts will not penalize such mistakes if they are corrected soon after.

The apostrophe of the abbreviated word `wont` is missing, i.e. `won't` should be the correct one.

Hi all,

I forgot to commit my Level-1 of individual project, so my commit history is Level-0..Level-2..Level-3 etc - maybe cos I was too excited to move on with the project.

I was googling on how to resolve this issue and tried using git rebase, but it seems that it is not so intuitive to insert a new commit between 2 existing commits.

Anyone has any experience with this? should I just delete the project and "redo" all levels again - this time i will remember to commit the Levels as I move along

Hello, I don't know whether to post this under the 3rd party libraries, or not.

I was doing the iP, and wondering if I could use regular expressions in the Level 4 - so that I can parse/validate the user input

For example, I want to do this to validate the *todo* command, which is followed by one or more lower case events that are to be added.

```java
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("todo [a-z]+$");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher("todo command");

        boolean matchFound = matcher.find();
        System.out.println("match?" + matchFound);
    ``}``
``}``
```

Thank you!

Prof @damithc due to me playing with git rebase - and some of the git history that I did not intend to change was accidentally changed. I decided to delete the old ip project and recreate a new one with the same name.

Learning points

1. Remember to regularly commit and don't get too excited
2. Rebase is a complicated feature, so I should test on another repo before touch the `ip` one

Hi @DominicFuMJ is it possible to show the loop portion how you continuously read in input - until the "bye" command is entered? I suspect that somehow your userInput variable is not being updated say:

```java
while(Loop)``{``
    userInput = myObj.nextLine();
``}``

What I recommend you to do is - maybe separate the assignment / initialisation of the variable `userInput`. General idea is as below

```java

String userInput;

while (!userInput.equals("bye")) ``{``
     userInput = myObj.nextLine();

I was inspired by the AB2 project so what I did was the parser takes in the raw user input, then there is a regex to split up the command, and route to the respective function. The logic to parse the command, and the logic to handle the parsed command is handled differently. Perhaps you could visit https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2 to be inspired.

I think you can directly interface with Storage or TaskList, but this might pose some challenge when your app needs to scale horizontally to add in more features - as the Java Class file might grow too big to manage.

Hello @jeong-jaeho I suspect this might be a different issue as #167, #151, #142 and #119. 

It appears that your Ubuntu terminal does not have a GUI? Are you running a GUI such as GNOME etc?

For Windows, I think we need to see your exact Java version using `java --version` command.
</panel>

<panel  header="**36 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/182#issuecomment-1925255103" expanded>

Hi @jeong-jaeho your Windows Java is too old, Version 1.8 implies that it is Java 8. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53642402/why-do-i-see-open-jdk-1-8-instead-of-java-8.

Please upgrade your Java on your Windows machine to Java 11 and above.

Your Linux one is probably working - just Java complaining that there is no GUI to output to. I think you can install a Desktop environment on WSL - but I personally feel it is not worth the effort. If you must use Linux, I recommend that you create a Ubuntu VM on either VirtualBox or VMWare Player. (You can use the Window Hypervisor to create a Ubuntu desktop with the GUI already enabled - but Windows hypervisor has some problems that are not so straightforward that you must know how to deal with.)

To summarise:
1. Upgrade your Windows Java to version 11 (since it is the latest one supported by our course)
2. Create a Ubuntu VM with VirtualBox or VMWare Player will be the easiest.

Hi @PateShin Patrick, it seems like the problem is with where your IntelliJ is pointing to for the default Java environment which will explain why VS Code is working fine. I think what I can recommend is point IntelliJ to the same JDK as the one in VS Code

Hi @bgopi23 not sure if I understood your question properly. 

Yes, the presence of a .git folder within your project directory is an indicator that your project is under revision control using Git.

In this case, if you do not specify inside the .gitignore file, every JAR file you create will automatically be tracked by Git - so Prof is trying to tell us not to commit the JAR file as a source code - rather introduce it as a release.

In summary, if your code updates are reflected on GitHub (meaning you can see the changes on GitHub), then your project is under revision control with Git.

After reading the PE page on the website, I have some uncertainties and would like to clarify them.

Firstly, regarding `response.NotInScope`: the tester could report everything from the Planned Enhancements section in the DG as feature flaws. The tester will gain credit for them. Does this affect the tester's accuracy? I think the website page is unclear about this.

Secondly, from my understanding, the tester can report all bugs as `severity.High`. If the developer then reponds with `severity.Low`, the tester can accept it and the tester's accuracy is unaffected (neither increases nor decreases).

If this is indeed true, then the tester could have just have _one_ accurate bug and "_SU_" the rest of the bugs by just reporting them as `severity.High` and accepting the dev's response, therefore achieving 100% accuracy. Is there some minimum amount of bugs required in order to qualify for this accuracy?

```
class A ``{``
    void doStuff() ``{``
        // ...
    ``}``

    void doMoreStuff() ``{``
        // ...
    ``}``

    void doSomething(boolean b) ``{``
        doStuff();
        if (b) ``{``
            doMoreStuff();
        ``}``
    ``}``
``}``
```
```
class B ``{``
    void doStuff() ``{``
        // ...
    ``}``

    void doMoreStuffIfB(boolean b) ``{``
        if (b) ``{``
           // ...
        ``}``
    ``}``

    void doSomething(boolean b) ``{``
        doStuff();
        doMoreStuffIfB(b);
    ``}``
``}``
```

Initially, class `B` seems to be a better option as `doSomething()` only has 1 layer of abstraction. However, on closer analysis, `doMoreStuffIfB()` is more restrictive than `doMoreStuff()`, which could potentially be used by another method with a different condition. Any thoughts?

Looking at your commit history, you merged from the master branch into branch-Level-7 instead of the other way. However, this merge did not do anything as the master branch was unmodified since the branch was created.

Hence, you need to merge branch-Level-7 into master and override the incorrect tag by passing -f into git tag:
```
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff branch-Level-7
git tag Level-7 -f
git push origin master
git push -f origin Level-7
```
Edit: You also need to force-push the new tag to override the remote tag.

Quote from the java.net link:

> This error comes from sun.launcher.LauncherHelper in the java.base module.
The reason for this is that the Main app extends Application and has a main
method. If that is the case, the LauncherHelper will check for the
javafx.graphics module to be present as a named module:

> Optional&lt;Module> om = ModuleLayer.boot().findModule(JAVAFX_GRAPHICS_MODULE_NAME);

> If that module is not present, the launch is aborted.
Hence, having the JavaFX libraries as jars on the classpath is not allowed
in this case.

In other words, it's the behaviour of sun.launcher.LauncherHelper itself. If you're interested you can read the source code here: https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk11/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/sun/launcher/LauncherHelper.java

There is an extensibility trade-off if you were to hardcode the strings directly in the tests.

For exmaple, if the `PREFIX` were to change in the future, the programmer would have to manually replace the strings in the test code, increasing the work required.

A similar issue occurs if you want to change the behaviour of a field in `Person`. With the original approach, as most of the strings are located in `CommandTestUtil.java`, it is relatively simple to update the tests. The other approach would require manually changing every hardcoded `name` string.

It refers to the objects that are related to O by association. For example:
```
class A ``{``
    B b;
    void m() ``{`` ``}``
``}``

class B ``{``
    void otherMethod() ``{`` ``}``
``}``
```

In this case, `A::m` can call `b.otherMethod()` without violating the law of demeter.

I would say it depends on the purpose of the window. If creating many windows is a beneficial feature to the user (e.g. for multitasking), it would affect many users and I'd consider it high or medium. On the other hand, if creating many windows is not useful to users, and it is relatively "difficult" to create so many windows, then only a very small percentage of users would have this issue, so it can be considered Low.
If you can argue that the bug is due to a limitation of JavaFX or the operating system, making it impossible to fix from the developer's pov, then it's NotInScope.

So I would argue that it's a feature flaw, as that seems to be the most accurate and valid (Sorting price by lexicographical order instead of numerical order doesn't make sense). What the DG says doesn't really matter, at its core it's a feature flaw. (My own opinion as a fellow student)

Only if the object has no more references (i.e., ready for garbage collection). In this case, when `cook()` method returns, the `d` object is no longer referenced at that exact point in time, so the `X` is required (note that the return arrow coincides horizontally with the `X` to indicate that they occur at the same time).

In other cases, the object may continue being referenced and we may not know when it is ready for garbage collection.

Prof @damithc ,

I wanted to clarify to what @E0735389 said about the timeline of the project, the website says that week-3 starts from Jan 26th onwards, so I was under the assumption that I should start the week-3 tasks as soon as possible.

In this sequence diagram from the textbook, the blue return arrow (from the Minefield's activation bar) and the green return arrow (from the Label's activation bar) both have no return value.

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/110999129/260167b5-9241-440f-8cf0-b22915900f4e)

For the blue return arrow the context seems clear, it is returning the new Minefield object being created.


_Q1. For the green return arrow above, if there is no return value, does this just mean there is nothing returned from the activation, i.e. a void function.?_

Furthermore, the textbook states that the return arrows are optional, but did not talk about return arrows with no return values.
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/110999129/872087eb-0b3e-4dbc-aaa5-8bb6ffdd4ab6)

_Q2. Are there situations where it is fine to draw a return arrow, **while omitting its return value** even if there is something being returned?_

To me it seemed like if a return arrow is drawn, and there is something being returned, then the return value should be mentioned as well, if not there is some ambiguity as to what the return arrow signifies and there would have been no point drawing the return arrow to begin with.

A different tester put two bugs into the same report, on each for commands `A` and `B` (call this issue 1). I'm guessing he did this because he felt that there should be the ability to undo `A` and undo `B` by allowing negative inputs, and they both had a similar idea.

I instead have reported them as two separate bugs (of two different severities even), but the developer has marked both of my bugs as duplicates of issue 1.

Would it make sense to mark 1 of the 2 bugs I reported as not a duplicate? The instructions on the website seem to apply more to the developer response phase:

As a developer I have the option to mark if bugs are incorrect are not, but it doesn't seem to have any mention about bug quality (except giving BOD to tester and try as hard as possible to replicate bugs).

Are quality of bug reports graded in some other way by someone else? While some of these seem to be implicitly tested when the severity level and reproducibility of a bug are contested by devs, there does not really seem to be a way to check for non-confrontational tone.

### Part 1
Say I'm a tester and I find some functionality bug through testing some command with the following integer inputs:

- `1` (works as intended)
- `0` (response not defined, command does not seem to work)
- `-1` (response not defined, command does not seem to work)

If the DG does not mention enough details about invalid inputs, I might assume that `0` and `-1` should fall into different equivalence partitions. Would it be reasonable to report them as 2 different issues during the PE? (since there's no penalty for reporting self-duplicates does it even matter?)

### Part 2
On the other hand, if I'm a dev and I receive these two as separate bugs, while it is possible to write two cases that handle `0` input and `-1` input independently, it feels like in real life, if I can show `0` and `-1` should reasonably fall under the same equivalence partition, then I would want to make one change that solves both cases. Would it make sense to mark the issue as a duplicate?

A few of our error messages use the phrase "address book" / "AddressBook" instead of our new app name "ClinicMate". For example:

```
    public static final String MESSAGE_NO_MATCHING_IC = "There is nobody with the IC you specified. \n"
            + "You may use the add command to add the specific person to the address book.";
```

Is an error message displayed to the user if some IC is incorrect. Can we treat `the address book` as a typo and replace it with the phrase `ClinicMate` instead?

We received a functionality bug report (AY2324S2-CS2103T-F14-2/tp#205) that our Log File still had mentions of `addressbook`. The suggestion was to replace mentions of address book with our app name, but this seems very much like a cosmetic enhancement.

Would adding a note in the UG that the name of the app may not be the same as what appears in the Log file due to legacy reasons be a valid fix that appropriately accounts for this "bug"?

I was interested in finding a way to automate some parts of the release process. I ended up find this github action that helps (https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release). This actions gets triggered every time an appropriate tag is pushed to the main team's repository, and helps create a draft release with the necessary `.jar` file uploaded. The relevant part of the workflow is here:

```
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v1.*'

jobs:
  ...
      - name: Build Jar
        run: ./gradlew clean shadowJar

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          draft: true
          prerelease: false
          files: build/libs/clinicmate.jar
          name: Release $``{`` github.ref_name ``}``
          tag_name: $``{`` github.ref ``}``
          fail_on_unmatched_files: true
          token: $``{`` secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN ``}``
```

We also created a modified version of this that generates a release every night using a cron job.

I think it would be cool if it were possible to generate and attach the user guide as well. If anyone has tried doing that do share below!

I have been using CoPilot within IntelliJ for all of the tP (getting good at generating CoPilot code feels like a useful skill in and of itself). Usually once I think of how I want a feature to be implemented, I would let CoPilot generate a majority of the important skeleton code (for a new class for example), and then change lower level details to match the design patterns I had in mind.

Based on the instructions for declaring code reuse in the website, it seems that the appropriate way to deal with this would be to add a comment above every new class and method I wrote mentioning that CoPilot was a source of inspiration for the code written.

Instead of this, would it be okay to mention that I "had CoPilot assistance for all of the code credited to me" in the README?

 If there are valid Feature Flaws reported during the PE Dry Run, are we allowed to change them in, even if this means adding new features that did not previously exist, while working on v1.4? Since these feature flaws could affect the actual PE grading, it feels like it would be important to add them.

@tankh99 the benefits of enums were already mentioned by @lhy-hoyin  posters mentioned a benefit of using enums already. In terms of effort, I personally feel ChatGPT / copilot is prefect for refactoring things like this (I used it for this task and wrote about it in my `AI.md`). For the sake of getting familiar with Java syntax you might want to do this manually, but in real life projects I would definitely opt for some kind of AI-assisted code generation to do this kind of refactoring.

@tankh99 I think a drawback of splitting save data into multiple files is if these files need to be shared with others, you would need to transfer multiple files over instead of just one. Was there some benefit you saw in having one file per model?

@TarinPairor I had a similar issue when using a '`public static void main`' method of a class that directly extends from '`Application`'.

What worked for me was creating another file '`Main.java`' and class '`Main`', and moving the entry point code (the '`main`' method) there.

@yisiox actually it does feel like `parseDateTime` is a method that would only ever be used in your `TaskFactory`. Why not just move the method out from `parser` into `TaskFactory` instead? I'm guessing that you would have to do some kind of parsing of subcommands (like `/from` and `/to`) in the `TaskFactory`, so to me it seems like a natural extension would be to use `parseDateTime` there as well.

@RingoftheKing I feel it could be argued that this is just a naming difference, and that every adjective-like interface could be rephrased into a noun-like interface. For example, you could rename the interface into `IAbilityable` (representing something that is able to use an ability) and then you could say a Healer **IS-A** IAbilityable. The example of a `GetAreable` interface from [cs2030s](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2223-s2/18-interface.html#Interface) comes to mind.

More generally, I feel like in the OOP paradigm, Classes are always essentially just a promise of features (or perhaps a promise of specific methods being available). So maybe the distinction between the idea of a "promise of features" and the "IS-A relationship" is not so important?

@camille-readbean your IDE probably did some preliminary parsing to determine that `cmd` is never `null`. You might make some change in the future which accidentally breaks this (and should hopefully be noticed during regression testing) so maybe it's not a bad idea to leave the assertion in.

@g-tejas at the bottom of this week's [project page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week6/project.html#4-get-familiar-with-the-code-base) they said don't rebase when merging PRs, and avoid it if you're syncing other local working branches with master.

They say the main reason is because it might mess up commit dates though, so I suppose if you're careful with the way you rebase, it might still be okay? My guess is there's some kind of auto grader that checks if you're constantly making commits through the weeks.

@jaejayrome the issue described by prof @damithc happened to my team as well. One of our team's PRs was working off a severely outdated master branch which kept causing the unit tests to fail.

Hmm @itstrueitstrueitsrealitsreal by that did you tutor mean that nothing is being returned either? I would assume that all return lines should indicate "handover of control", since that's why the activation bar can end after the return arrow (if there was a return arrow, and control is not handed over, then there is a contradiction because it means the function has not actually returned yet).

@damithc thanks prof. I took a closer look at the response given by the team. I realised the team's response to Issue 1 only addresses command `A` and makes no mention of command `B`. 

I intend to mark my bug that mentions command `B` as a duplicate (both of my issues are FeatureFlaws, and both commands are different objects with their own parser, so I believe it is impossible that rectifying the flaw in one command will fix the flaw in the other).

Given that the dev team's response does not mention command `B` at all how should I interpret their response? I was thinking I could try replacing every mention of `A` with `B` and respond to that instead, but I'm not sure if I am then misunderstanding their intended design of command `B`.

The command input formats of `A` and `B` are almost identical. Given this, another way could be to try and infer how the team would have argued if they were directly addressing the flaw in command `B` (based on their argument for `A`), in the context of what `B` is suppose to do, and try responding to that instead?

Would it be more accurate to say that **we cannot be sure if anything is being returned by the call to the Logic object's `newGame()` method**. All we can say is that if an object is returned it is not important to this diagram? The only thing we can say for certain is that the green arrow indicates the return of control back to the caller of the `newGame()` method?

@cheahTJ I believe it can be a useful way to start architecting a solution to a real world problem.

Like in the example given:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/110999129/d28cef5c-419e-458d-8224-3f462243a332)

If you start out by directly trying to create a Class Diagram (more methods, navigability, maybe even programming language specific features?) you might have to make a lot of edits every time you realise there's a problem, because there's more information to maintain. Since the OODM has less information, it means it's easier to change and maintain when you're still in some initial planning phase.

My guess would be that in a SWE team, if you're given a new project to solve some problem, you might try to see how different parts of the problem are linked conceptually, and so start out with a OODM/CCD. Once you're fairly certain that you've got a good idea of the problem, you could easily adapt your CCD into a Class Diagram (if appropriate/necessary) with a bit more detail. Or maybe you're not even using an OOP language, so you'll need to adapt your CCD into something appropriate for your team's tech stack.

>CCDs represents the class structure of the problem domain and not their behavior

I think this is just used in the same sense that Class Diagrams don't show exactly how Classes behave wrt each other:

I get the impression that buffers are meant to be more explicit (stakeholders/ other devs know that a specific period is meant to be a buffer period), while padding is a bit of a "lazier" way to make sure you don't run afoul of an agreed deadline by estimating you would need a long time.

I don't think that's the main focus. In the Class Diagram you highlighted, there is no association line being drawn between Chair and Table, hence there should be no associations between Chair and Table. This means that the object diagram is incorrect (because it IS showing an association between the Chair and Table)

In the lecture recording, it was mentioned that the 2nd CCD is more "natural" and thus a better pick to answer the question. I am confused by the prof's explanation, as during the tutorial, the same CCD is mentioned as a negative example. There could be instances where Tom exist as a coordinator for one course and an instructor for the other course. When this happens, you would need 2 instances of Tom in the CCD, which is not ideal. May I know which the better CCD and what is the rationale behind it? Thank you!

In the lecture briefing, it was mentioned that the usage of bidirectional arrows can be different even if the code can be the same, and the only way we can tell is by the context and the intent of the design. For the exam, may I know if we have to infer the context ourselves, or will it be explicitly stated for us? Thank you!

How do we tell that there is only 2 layers of abstraction here? My reasoning is that since there are multiple sections, each section is like one "layer" of abstraction since they can be abstracted out, so it should be like 4-5 layers.

My tester seems to have reported a feature flaw as a documentation bug, during the the documentation phase. Does that serve as grounds for rejection? The tester reported the bug during the documentation stage, where he seems to have changed the type so that it becomes "valid" during the documentation stage.

My feature enables someone to open a new window from the GUI, however, since the new window does not close by itself, the user can deliberately sabotage the application and make it lag my opening multiple tabs all at once. In my UG, I have stated explicitly that users have to close the window

I have actually provided a reminder to the user to close the window(albeit in a less imperative way, using the word "may" instead of "must")

Right now, the tester assigned a Severity.High response, as he states that it can cause lag. 

May I ask if its valid? He was not actually able to cause lag to the system, as he simply stated that the hypothetically it can cause lag. 

In the case that it's a valid issue, would be it be more appropriate to lower the severity or go for Response.NotInScope? 

For the case of Response.NotInScope, there has been reminders for users to close the window once the function has completed execution, as stated in the evidence above. 

For the case of lower severity, the user can simply close the window, and its very rare for users to open so many windows at a time without closing it.

My CommandHelper function actually loads up a separate GUI that prompts users for the fields needed to construct an add command.

For my feature in AB3, there is a popup GUI window that prompts the user to add the details of a new contact step by step. Once all the details have been entered, the user will have to manually close the window to exit the GUI.

For my portion on the DG, I talked about my feature which prompts the user to enter the details of the contacts they want to add. 
I split the DG into stages of accepting different fields, as shown in the examples below

The first diagram illustrates the flow of entering the email field, while the second diagram illustrates the flow of entering the name field. 

In the use case of the DG, I gave an example of the wrong input by the user, and and a correct input afterwards, then I used to diagram above to illustrate the sequence of the flow of the user actions

<img width="483" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/142142406/2297545a-ff10-4ecb-9b05-d24161ed3915">

May I know if this may come off as too repetitive? The diagrams and the flow of actions are largely similar, but the type of 'wrong inputs' for name and email fields are fundamentally different.

@flexibo My CommandHelper function actually loads up a separate GUI that prompts users for the fields needed to construct an `add` command. Hence, I split it into 2 diagrams, a diagram that explains the overall flow for the user, and a diagram showing the process for accepting each type of input for the user.

May I seek your feedback regarding these 2 diagrams? Do you think they are sufficient in explaining my feature? Thank you!

Hello @flexibo , thank you so much for your feedback! My diagram is closer to method 2 as of now, and it looks something like this:

I can't seem to find it on the 2103 website even though it exists on the puml documentation, so I am worried that i will get penalised for the using non compliant notation. 

Regarding my diagrams, do you think that it would be clearer if I were to add a sequence diagram in explaining the addbystep functionality? Or would it come off as redundant to the reader

@aureliony hmm, my feature is to make adding contacts easier. You can create many windows, but the UG asks the user to close the window once they have added the contacts, does this fulfil the first condition of notInScope?

 I actually tried to create 1000 windows just to stress test the application, but there was no lag observed, so can it be counted as a bug? (Are "hypothetical" bugs considered bugs to begin with?"

@itstrueitstrueitsrealitsreal, thank you for your input! Can I ask if your feature is actually a popup window as well? For your issue, it seems that the tester tried to open 2 instances of the application at once. My feature is a popup window from the application (like the help window), the user can open multiple popup windows at once. The popup windows do not interact with the data of the application in any way. Do you think I will be able to use a similar argument as your response? Thank you!

@damithc Hello Prof, may I double check regarding the definition of a bug? Because in this case, the tester was not able cause lag within the application (He made the claim that it *can* cause lag). Similarly, if AB3 were to start lagging after adding (say a few million contacts), is it still the fault of the developer?

Hmm, I think it depends on the application requirements. If you frequently need to find the breeder of a Cat, it would make sense to have the Person stored in the Cat class.

On the other hand if all you care about is finding the Cat bred by a Person, then storing the Cat in the Person class may be more suitable.

Regarding the two unidirectional arrows, I'm unable to think of a situation where a single bidirectional arrow would not portray the same information. Did you have a scenario in mind?

Without the `static` keyword, you can have multiple instances of the class, each having their own `STORAGE`. This could result in there being multiple different `STORAGE`s.

When you tag it as `final`, that means the `STORAGE` is a constant only within an instance of a class. So you can't change it throughout the lifetime of that object.

However when you declare something with the `static final` keywords, that means it is a constant that exists even without an instance of the class being created.

e.g.
If you have a `Math.PI` that has only been declared as `final` (no `static`), you could potentially have the following scenario

```java
Math Math1 = new Math(3.14);
Math Math2 = new Math(3.15);
Math Math3 = new Math(3);

Math1.PI = 3.14
Math2.PI = 3.15
Math3.PI = 3
```

But if you declare it with `static final`, you will be able to ensure that `Math.PI` always refers to the same value. You also would not need to instantiate the class to refer to that value.

I think the all caps rule is only for declared constants (like line 2 and 3 in your code snippet), so we shouldn't use it for naming arguments we pass into methods.

The flow of information from remote to your local branch is something like this
`remote master (repo) --> origin/master (local tracking branch) --> master (local branch)`

Your local `master` branch was current with the `origin/master` local tracking branch, but the `origin/master` local tracking branch was not up to date with the remote `master`.

I suspect the problem could lie in line `18` of your `Storage.java`:

`"src/main/java/data/hirwan.txt";`

Just to share my PR review process:

1. Understand what the PR is supposed to achieve.
1. Go through the code to see what was changed, and get a rough understanding of how it was done.
    Things I look out for:
    1. Code readability
    1. Comments
    1. Any egregious coding standard/quality violations
1. If it was a significant feature (e.g. new command, UI changes), pull the PR and test the MSS.

On @jyztintan's 3rd point, I feel like it is the responsibility of the developer submitting the PR to ensure the program is in a usable state before submitting the PR, so pulling the PR and testing it should not be required every time.

If I'm understanding the question right, it seems you want bidirectional navigability between `Order` and `Person` objects.

Maybe a `private final Person` field in your `Order` class? Assuming the `Person` the `Order` is associated with doesn't change. Then you could pass the `Person` as an argument to the `Order`'s constructor.

Thanks for the quick reply prof!

Just to make sure I understand it correctly, editing the error message while remaining in the same "specificity level" is alright.

e.g. "time format incorrect!" -&gt; "time should be in the format hh:mm" would be allowed, but

"Invalid syntax" -&gt; "time format incorrect" would not be?

Isn't it also true that the `Observed` must implement some sort of `addObservers()` and `notifyObservers()` methods? That sounds to me like having to implement an interface.

When discussing the problem domain, we are generally interested in how the entities are interacting with each other in the real world. 

So we should stick to terms used to describe stuff in the real world, rather than terms like _variable_ and _methods_, which only come into play when we begin implementing solutions to the problem.

I general rule I follow is: If I can use the term when speaking with my parents, it probably isn't implementation-specific. 😆

What does it mean for an object diagram to comply with a class diagram? My perspective is that it means the object diagram does not contain any details that would contradict the information provided in a given class diagram.

Q3 of the FAQ states that:
> A: In that case, we go by the reasonable 'correct' behavior that one expects. For example, the UG might not specify what happens if a user typed an extra space after the first keyword of the command (e.g., mark[SPACE]1 vs mark[SPACE][SPACE]1) in which case the reasonable correct behavior is to ignore the extra space.

and Q5 of the FAQ states that:
> A: Can be allowed only if the current behavior causes the software to misbehave (i.e., crash, give incorrect results, store inconsistent data, or make it unusable for typical users).
Accepting seemingly 'unsuitable' values for an input (e.g., accepting numbers for a person name, empty value as a parameter):
This is not considered 'incorrect' (giving more freedom to the user is not necessarily incorrect) unless those unsuitable values causes the application to misbehave.
Validity checks on edits to the data file:
As per AB3 UG (which states the current level of support for editing the data file manually), only valid edits will be supported. If the file is invalid, the app will start with an empty file (not crash). You may rectify only if the current level of support doesn't meet that bar. Furthermore, you may state in the UG that certain incorrect edits to the datafile can result in unexpected behaviors, and caution users to edit the file only if they know what they are doing.
Handling extraneous inputs (e.g., extra parameters, repeated parameters etc.) in commands:
The command 'forgiving' these extraneous inputs (i.e., giving an output same as or similar to if those inputs are not present) is not incorrect. You can mention in the UG that such inputs will be ignored. AB3 already does a similar thing for some commands. Any special handling of such inputs can be left as a future enhancement.

Our team's product has a bug whereby starting datetimes for an event can be after the ending datetime. This means that it does qualify as "incorrect behaviour" based on Q3. However, in Q5, we can tweak validity checks "only if the current behaviour causes the software to misbehave". Are we allowed to fix this bug?

Moreover, is linking to the GitHub page of the source file that I had my inspiration from enough, or would putting in the GitHub permalink be better? It seems that putting the GitHub permalink would violate the checkstyle's maximum line length requirements.

> I think it might make sense in other weakly typed languages. However since Java is strongly typed, if you try to pass a `null` into a function expecting an `int` it won't even compile. So I don't think it's something we need to be concerned about in this case.

To add on, this is because `int` is a primitive type. If we use `Integer` instead, then yes I think `null` should be an equivalence partition.

Our group opted to use the factory design pattern so that the functionalities of each command is more contained within the commands package to make it more extensible. However we're not sure how to draw the UML sequence diagram for it. Below is what we currently have:

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/107540644/946c6f74-7ae4-463c-8b0a-d09e0ae82d61)

How it works is:
1. `LogicManager` passes the user input to an `AddressBookParser`.
2. `AddressBookParser` uses the static method `CommandType::valueOf` (`CommandType` is an enum) to get the relevant command type.
3. `AddressBookParser` calls `createCommand()` of the command type enum object to get a `Command` object instantiated with the user input arguments.
4. The `Command` object is passed back to logic manager which can now execute it.

Any advice on whether this is correctly represented? Or if anyone can point us to a resource on how to draw sequence diagrams for enum factories it would be much appreciated. TIA

## The Aim
I'm aiming for code that is easily extensible in the sense that I can add new types of `Task` and `Handler`(a class encapsulating a the response to a command) easily. Therefore I want utility classes like `Storage` and `Parser` to only see `Task` and `Handler` instead of the specific subtypes like `TodoTask`. 

### What I Did
So far, I elected to use the Factory design pattern where there is a `TaskFactory` class that is responsible for creating a `Task` of the correct concrete subclass through a factory method, and similarly for `Handler`. This is an improvement over a previous design where `Task` itself handled the creation of subclasses, but this meant it "knew" its own subclasses, breaking abstraction. The intention is that adding a new type of task or command amounts to simply defining a new subclass of `Task` and/or new subclasses of `Handler` (for the associated commands), and modifying the factory methods' switch cases.

### The Problem
However, suppose the `Parser` has the following static methods:
```java
public static LocalDateTime parseDateTime(String dateTime) ``{``
    return LocalDateTime.parse(dateTime, DATETIME_FORMAT);
``}``

public static Task parseStorageEntry(String entry) ``{``
    String[] data = entry.split(",");
    return TaskFactory.of(data);
``}``
```
Somewhere down the line, `TaskFactory` will require `parseDateTime` to function, so I understand it as circularly dependent (Parser -&gt; TaskFactory -&gt; *Task -&gt; Parser). So to prevent this I think I can either
1. Separate `Parser` more finely into `StorageParser`, `InputParser`, `DateTimeParser`, `AuxiliaryParser`, etc. This means `StorageParser` and `InputParser` are dependent on `Task` and `Handler` which are dependent on sibling classes `DataTimeParser` and `AuxiliaryParser`. But the main thing that doesn't feel right to me here is that none of these parser classes share fields or methods so do I just leave them as separate unrelated classes? I read of something called [marker interfaces](https://www.baeldung.com/java-marker-interfaces), - should I make them all implement an empty `Parser` interface to symbolize that they have a static `parse` method? (The methods are static thus the subclasses can't override some generic `parse`).
2. Again separate `Parser` into more specific subclasses, but make the `parse` methods generic and not static, meaning it can be overridden. So instead of the current approach where `Parser.parse*` can be invoked without instantiating a class, specific parsers need to be instantiated. Is this a better design over the previous?
3. Not have a `Parser`. Is this allowed?

I could also be going down the wrong direction entirely, if that is so do advise. Thanks in advance for any help.

Small edit: on the topic of enums I found [enum factory pattern](https://jvmaware.com/enum-as-factory/). On top of the options listed above there is another option of making the subclasses of `Task` handle date time by themselves, but this means that each subclass potentially has a different format.

Perhaps for clarity and the benefit of others who ran into the same issue as I did too, the issue seems to indeed be that the folder containing the file needs to be created first if it does not already exist.

A possible program flow is thus
```java
File myfile = new File("./data/bit.txt");
boolean isFolderMade = file.getParentFile().mkdirs(); // make parent folder
boolean isFileMade = file.createNewFile();
if (isFolderMade || isFileMade) ``{``
    // file surely missing
``}``

Hi @tankh99, I too am inclined towards keeping them in the same file for consideration of code complexity and potential points of failure. Since we will have to perform more file IO operations, I thought that multiple files may give rise to a situation whereby data is desynchronized if say one of three write operations fail. Suppose it is the last write operation that failed, I'd then have decide if I should undo the previous two writes. Also if new types of tasks were required in future it might be harder to refactor.

Using the `split` method of strings to read from files like `String[] taskInfo = line.split(",")` has worked well for me as regular expressions are quite robust, but a conditional switch is still necessary to choose the type of task to instantiate. I'm also thinking it can be used in some cases to handle cases where the user enters extraneous whitespaces also to guard against weird formatting when saving it to the disk. In example, for taking input from the user,
```java
String[] command = sc.nextLine().split("\\s+(/(from|to|by)\\s+)?");
```
and something similar may be able to recover from extraneous characters when reading from the file.

That said, I do see advantages for keeping the files separate in that it's easier to recover from a corrupted task type, and storage could be optimized for each type of task or have specialized handling of each type, and error handling is more readable for more specialized code. 

Maybe there could be some middle ground like storing the different types together in a file but creating handlers for each new type as separate classes or files. It does seem overly ambitious though as it's mostly to accommodate adding of new types without guarantee that it will be a requirement. If anyone has any thoughts on this, do advise.

I think the key here is to recognize that we are familiar with our editors expanding our tab input as some number of spaces, but tabs as actual tab characters is different from whitespaces. 

The arguments for using spaces instead of tabs would be suppose you had to wrap a line but line up function parameters, it is likely tabs and spaces need to be mixed to align it exactly. Yet tab widths could differ from device to device, so it may look different when transferred to another device. For languages like python where indentation matters, mixing of tabs and spaces could lead to errors, and may not be easy to visually catch. Spaces are also more consistent when copied over to e.g. forums, the web. So overall, tabs tend to require spaces on top of tabs anyways, and spaces are more robust.

I do agree now that it's more so personal choice depending on how futureproof / how you anticipate the project to evolve. 

I ended up going for the factory design pattern - using a factory class to create and return the different subclasses of `Task`. This makes it so that I can easily extend the code in case of new types of tasks (also did the same for logic, which it has helped since the iP increments tend to add new commands, minimizing the code I have to change) as all other classes only ever see the `Task` type instead of the specific subclass. Also solved a circular dependency issue which I had between the `Parser` and `Task`.

I'm not too sure about this, but I think the idea here is that we can let the classes doing the "low level" interactions handle the specific errors, and `Duke` doesn't need to be privy to specific errors. For example, `Storage` may encounter a `IOException` and is capable of handling it by terminating the attempt, but ultimately still rethrows the exception as a `DukeException` so that `Duke` is aware that something went wrong, but doesn't need to know the details. Also, `Duke` can log the error message rethrown by `Storage` for the user, which may be specific like `"failed to read file"` etc.

Hi @ejnan, you didn't specify what does not work so I'm assuming your question is why your code does not parse times involving AM and PM. If so, the issue originates in line 32 of your `DateTimeUtils`
```java
.parseDefaulting(ChronoField.HOUR_OF_DAY, 23) // Default to end of day (23:59)
```
`ChronoField.HOUR_OF_DAY` is for 24 hour time, so it conflicts with AM and PM. You can try the following to see that it's what's causing it to throw an error.
```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatterBuilder;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoField;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Test ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()
                .appendPattern("d/M/yyyy h:mm a")
                .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.YEAR_OF_ERA, LocalDate.now().getYear())
                // .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.HOUR_OF_DAY, 23) // Default to end of day (23:59)
                // .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.MINUTE_OF_HOUR, 59)
                .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.CLOCK_HOUR_OF_AMPM, 11)
                .parseDefaulting(ChronoField.AMPM_OF_DAY, 1)
                .parseCaseInsensitive()
                .toFormatter(Locale.ENGLISH);
        String input = "2/12/2022 6:30 PM";
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(input, formatter);
        System.out.println(dateTime);
    ``}``
``}``
```
That said I agree with @kokerinks that it's worth considering restructuring the code for handling date time (as the next increment after Level-8 involves major refactoring, so you can spare yourself some pain here).

@drustanyjt I wanted a unified and consistent format for printing also, so I wanted the subclasses of `Tasks` to call on some resource when processing `toString`. You're right that I missed that I can separate this out as this isn't "parsing" but rather formatting the output. Thank you for the input!

Currently I have committed to having a parsers package where `Parser` is the marker interface, then `InputParser`, `IntervalParser` (for BCD-extension) and `DateTimeParser` implement this interface. The storage parsing is a separate abstract `StorageParser` and concrete `TaskStorageParser`, and I made `Storage` use generics so it isn't specific to just handling `Task`. Also I replaced the factory classes in favour of enum factories, so types and commands have only fixed values, killing two birds with one stone. That said, I may have fallen into the premature optimisation trap not in the sense of speed but in the sense of extensibility, though hopefully it makes future increments easier.

@neyapraveen @kiwibang Thank you for the detailed comments. Ultimately I can agree with both of you that approach 1 is best in this case, and it's what I have gone with as well. It's the only place in the project so far that has this problem, so I think proliferation of marker interfaces should not be a problem. I can also keep the advantage of having them as static methods and having the package indicate that they have the parsing functionality.

I think @drustanyjt made a good point that while the static analysis done by intellij confirms that that something will never occur, we might not notice when we change our code in the future and this is no longer the case, so I agree it might be worth keeping some of the assertions anyways.

>Why doesn't an AssertionError allow access to the object that generated it? Similarly, why not pass an arbitrary object from the assertion to the AssertionError constructor in place of a detail message? Access to these objects would encourage programmers to attempt to recover from assertion failures, which defeats the purpose of the facility.

>Why is AssertionError a subclass of Error rather than RuntimeException? This issue was controversial. The expert group discussed it at length, and came to the conclusion that Error was more appropriate to discourage programmers from attempting to recover from assertion failures.

I feel the resource is trying to convey that unlike error handling, which allows your program to gracefully recover from any error, asserts are not meant to be "recovered" from. They are more of a tool to help the programmer detect and correct bugs during testing and also tell readers information (like that of control flow invariants, assert false is a nice way to indicate default is never executed).

Using assertions to do input validation is also dangerous since it can be turned off, so if it is in any way important to the logic of the program it is fatal.

@logical-1985516 This is subjective but I think it's only okay if you don't have complex logic visible in each case. For example, if the following reaches over 30 Loc because there's simply many commands I think it's mostly unavoidable and still clear to read. The details are also abstracted behind the methods which is also helpful since some cases have similar validation as @bryanyee33 suggested.
```java
String command = someParsingLogic(input);
String[] args = otherParsingLogic(input);
switch (command) ``{``
case "list":
    someListSpecificArgsValidation(args);
    return new ListCommand(args);
case "todo":

    return new TodoCommand(args);
...

For this specific case, a ternary statement is probably most succinct and clear, and skips the initial value altogether.
```java
int a = (condition) ? 1 : 2;
```
But it does seem to fit somewhat into the case as explained by
> Sometimes it is impossible to initialize a variable to a valid value where it is declared. In these cases it should be left uninitialized rather than initialized to some phony value.

so it should be ok to leave it uninitialised, especially if it is set non trivially and `a` has no meaningful default value. However I think the guideline was probably aimed at non primitive types with no meaningful default, perhaps like:
```java
Command command;
if (condition) ``{``
    someLogic();
    command = new redCommand();
``}`` else ``{``
    otherLogic();
    command = new blueCommand();
``}``
command.execute();

If the program is executed from `C:/Users/User/Desktop/ip`, then `./src/main/java/duke/memory/output.txt` means to look for a output.txt in `C:/Users/User/Desktop/ip/src/main/java/duke/memory/output.txt`. Running it in `C:/Users/User/Documents` yields `C:/Users/User/Documents/ip/src/main/java/duke/memory/output.txt`.

@ZhiWei1010 You can try 
1. delete the contents of `/bin`
2. change line 16 to `if ! javac -cp ../src/main/java -Xlint:none -d ../bin ../src/main/java/duke/*.java`
3. change line 23 to use the fully qualified name of the class `java -classpath ../bin duke.Duke &lt; input.txt > ACTUAL.txt`

I think what happened was when ran from the IDE (or could be a windows environment thing), the file path to the jpg is case insensitive but this is no longer the case when ran from the jar (or could be a gnu/linux environment thing), so the error doesn't appear in normal testing but happens when the jar file is run (if there is a mismatch between file paths in terms of upper/lowercase).

@Darkarche3 Can I check how did you know it was not returned? Your master and BCD-extension branches it doesn't seem to match the code you sent here, as it seems like the return value isn't assigned to anything, and only the empty string is returned. 

If you are using IntelliJ you can use the [debugger](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/debugging-code.html) and specifically the feature to [step](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/stepping-through-the-program.html) through the program to see what is happening (as recommended by the week 6 topics).

@chewbum At a cursory glance, your changes to `Person.java` caused `testutil/TypicalPersons.java` to fail to initialize `JAMAL` due to a bug in `Person::withDefaultMeetingA`. This meant that none of the typical persons, specifically `AMY`, "do not exist" which is what causes the very first error in your screenshot. I believe most of the failing tests are due to this.

I think it's not an issue, but should be the nesting can be eliminated by writing it like
```

This compiles, but will throw an error when ran:
```java
public class bar ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        new foo();
    ``}``
``}``

class foo ``{``
    private static int f() ``{``
        throw new RuntimeException();
    ``}``
    private static int x = f();
``}``
```
As I understand this is essentially what is happening to `TypicalPersons` which calls `withDefaultMeetingA` which has a value that fails the newly added condition of not being before the current time. Many tests import from `TypicalPersons`, which is why so many broke. The fact that it compiles and runs without error if the the foo class is instantiated is also why some of the other tests did not break.

`.` in the unix world means the current directory, thus `git add .` stages every changed file in the current directory. It's possible that running a program caused a change in the bin file indirectly.

You can do `git add -u` to only stage tracked files.

The course materials are [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/errorHandling.html#logging).

I find it useful in the context of either parallel code or large code bases where many objects exist simultaneously and code execution is difficult to trace. I can log at the "info" level which objects have been instantiated and which subroutines are running, and if debugging, use the higher severity levels and simply turn off the logging if I don't need them anymore. This is advantageous over printing to standard out, in which case I have to go back and delete or comment out debug print statements.

Concur that \*..5 is probably wrong?

Bit of trivia the [Kleene star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star) ($\&hat;\*$) applied to a set of strings means "any number of repetitions of strings from the set". e.g. $\\``{``a,b\\``}``\&hat;\*=\\``{``\epsilon, a, b, aa, bb, ab, ba, aaa, bbb, \dots \\``}``$. This is where the use of \* in regex comes from. I see it as $a\&hat;1=a$, $a\&hat;2=aa$, $a\&hat;3=aaa$ so $a\&hat;\*$ is like a wildcard exponent. I guess \* tends to have the meaning of "any number of".

The example seems to imply that expanding everything into the lowest level reasonable isn't the same as having a single level of abstraction, being that there exists a higher level to expand in the first place. But it does show that we don't have to follow SLAP rigidly. SLAP does apply here though since the tutorial example given has the resulting effect of a (somewhat) long method and could stand to benefit in terms of readability by abstracting the high level actions behind methods, so we are inclined to SLAP it.

Hi I think you can try following this guide, where you first get the home directory then append it to the front using the Paths.get method so the it can be used across different systems before adding the relevant file path.

The dependency is because of the Function call with `handout` as parameter, but I think it is ok to have both.

Sorry for that. 

Showing attributes is the same as the association line. Therefore, we can use attributes instead of association lines. However, attributes can also be omitted. 

Therefore, if we use attributes instead of the association line and then omit that attribute(consider it as not important), we can just not show it right?

Is it because the values don't "mean" anything persay unlike `Priority` for instance which has a `HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW` of 0, 1, 2? That is, we can just check whether the integer is in range 0 to 10000 before assigning it instead of using an enum

Could it also be inappropriate to use an enum for 10000 values? It seems extremely cumbersome

Hi, we had an extra validation for a user input that got somehow deleted through some other commits right before PE-D. Would it be a violation of v1.4 if we bring this back now?

1. If an illegal modification is made that flouts v1.4 and it's not possible to revert the PR or too tedious to rollback the commit, is it possible to make another PR removing the illegal mods without facing penalty?
2. We had bugs that were reported regarding how interviews can be added where the end time precedes start time, and where the date precedes the current date. Is it okay to handle these erroneous user inputs because it may lead to incorrect/inconsistent data? And consequently add new error messages or expand current error messages for these cases.

For example if I edit the JSON to have a non-ascii char such as an emoji, the application will launch with no data and display the exception in the terminal. This seems to be how it worked for AB3 fields such as email, so is it fine to maintain this standard and not treat it as a bug?

I used `./gradlew clean shadowJar` to create the file. Switching the local version of Java to 17 is not an option since MacOS can only run `javafx` on Azul 11 and the `jar` file is required to run on any OS and any version of Java that is 11 or later

Hi, I have the following 2 queries: 

1. Is it an issue if a commit has the wrong **message**? I.e. "Level 5. Automated Text UI Testing" when this is not one of the levels.

2. After pushing tags I noticed newer tags are stacked onto previous commits for past increments. So now my Level-0 commit has tags Level-5 to 0. Is this a major issue for the grader and how do I rectify it?

What I've mainly tried to rectify this: 
Deleted all tags both locally and on remote and ran `git tag <name> <commit hash>` to try to tag it to a specific commit. 

I suspect the issue is coming when I "push all tags" everytime I commit an increment:

Not sure if this is a fix but after creating your jar file with gradle, you should have a jar file that is `&lt;yourmainclass>.jar` which is the one you should be executing locally not the `ip.jar`. Before creating the jar file with gradle, in your `shadowJAR `object for the build gradle, try adding `archiveFileName = &lt;yourmainclass>.jar`

I followed the steps in the gradle tutorial to create a jar file with no issues

Okay this has been resolved by ensuring that the `java --version` in the Intellij terminal is also set to Azul 11. It is not sufficient that the Project SDK alone is Azul 11.

It seems like `Objects.requireNonNull(x)` is better since it is explicitly designed for parameter validation in methods and constructors. Additionally, assert statements seem to be better left out of production code since we can still recover from exceptions thrown by `Objects.requireNonNull(x)` whereas we're meant to use assertions in testing and bug-fixing and allow exceptions from assertions to happen

Moreover `Objects.requireNonNull(x)` being a method instead of a keyword like `assert` allows us to pass in the results of another methods directly into the null-check instead of create a variable first and then compare that variable using `assert`

While its true that at the scale of AB3 its meaningless to talk about asymptotic performance, I feel like if O(n) was possible we should go for it? **As long as its readable** then writing more efficient methods now just saves future work when the product does need to be much more scalable.

Even for readability, we can use abstraction to hide the confusing details that tend to crop up with cleverer methods. The user of a search method for example does not need to see that a binary-search is implemented as opposed to be a simple for-loop

In my opinion its better not to do so as then the reference of where `ErrorMessage` is coming from is unclear i.e. the reader would instinctively search through the class to find the reference and failing to do so, would have to intuit that its an import

More importantly the method suggested will lead to a lot of unused imports which is a checkstyle violation and is also cumbersome

In this case, I would refer to the earlier point still. Unless for use in test code where we just use constants without worrying about where they came from, I think functional code should keep references clear especially if they are not findable easily in the current class itself

Thanks prof, just 1 more question: 
Suppose I want to change **which** error message I want to throw upon an erroneous user input without adding or changing any error messages, would this be okay? I.e. if a user enters an invalid phone number, throw invalid phone exception instead of invalid command format. Since the latter may be misleading

@damithc 
When a phone number is wrong, the current message is:
"Invalid Command Format! 
Parameters: applicant_status [PHONE] s/[STATUS]
Example usage: applicant_status 98362254 s/accepted"

A tester reported this as misleading since it doesn't inform that the phone number is wrong, but as if that the command itself was wrong ie missing some parameter etc

So we wished to switch to the existing "Phone numbers must contain 3 digits, and only numbers" error message

The warning is likely since this original commit was to a branch in my fork of our team repo which was later merged to the team repo

Just to clarify, this is not the commit in which this line of code was first added. It's just showing that it was there during/before v1.3 

We suspect it got left out because we refactored the `execute` method of the `AddInterviewCommand` since it was too long, and when abstracting out multiple lines of code to become new methods, this line got left out since it is its own logical piece.

I have one instance of code reuse with credit in my tp code, but it is not Java functional code. Specifically, some bash scripts that were helpful for my team at some point but not anymore.

For our tp, we have `Order` and `Person`. Each `Person` has a `List&lt;Order>`. However, `Order` class does not hold any `Person` object identifier, meaning that you can't go from `Order` to `Person`. 

In the GUI, we need to display both the `Order` and the `Person` it belongs to. 

Was wondering what's the best way to do this?

- Use circular references `:Person` -&gt; `:Order` and `:Person` -&gt; `:Order` by having a `Order::setPerson` method
- Pass `Pair&lt;Person, Order>` instance around

Context: My group was facing a huge annoying major bug which the person in charge couldn't fix.

GitHub doesn't seem to allow re-forking their repo because I already have a fork, so I cannot PR to their fork. So I'm cloning their PR, trying my fixes, then sending patches for them to apply once resolved. This lets them do their PR via the course forking workflow, but I don't get attributed for the changes I made, and then Git blame won't be effective anymore which may be troublesome down the line. It doesn't make sense for me to PR instead because they did the majority of the work. I do not think it is not a good idea to force merge code with major bugs to `master`, but the course workflow doesn't recognise PRs made to branches. 

What's the best way out of this? Or do I have to get write access to their repo, make a new branch on their repo and then PR from their repo to the original branch the PR is on (or just write to their branch directly and risk merge conflict)?

The [coding style](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#comments) for Javadoc notes to have the first sentence of method Javadoc start in the form `Returns...`, etc.

The autoformatter and the existing guide already takes care of most of the Javadoc style so I tried to configure `checkstyle` to check that the first word is capitalized and ends in "s". 

I can get the capitalization lint working, but I can't seem to get the ending to work.

```xml
<module name="Regexp">
    <property name="format" value="\/\*\*\s+?\* \w+?(?<!s)\b"/>
    <property name="message"
        value="Javadoc method description must start with a capitalized word ending in 's'"/>
    <property name="ignoreComments" value="false"/>
    <property name="illegalPattern" value="true"/>
</module>
```

I've tried testing both the above regex and other variations of `\/\*\*\s+?\* (?!.+?s).\b`. They work on online testers.


Or do lookarounds just not work in the `Regexp` module and require more sophisticated checks?

Hi @hansstanley 

Thanks for the comment. I'm aware of .editorconfig.

I suspect it's how the checkstyle is configured rather than my editor/.editorconfig settings because continuation indent of 4 doesn't adhere to the code style from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html#layout), as mentioned in my previous comment

I think I will stick to extracting the lambda into a separate method. Which does not have the checkstyle warning.

`\/\*\*\s+?\* \w+?(?&lt;!s)\b` has a negative lookbehind to not capture anything inside the (?&lt;!)

`\/\*\*\s+?\* (?!.+?s\b).` (I realised the one above had a few errors) is a negative lookahead to not capture anything inside the (?!) and only match after.

I suspect it's a error on my part, can't say I'm the best at lookarounds

TIL there's regex quantifiers too, regex is way too complicated haha

A `jar` file is actually a `zip` file which you can unzip. In Windows if you select the option to always show file extensions it should still be a `jar` file. Or you may wish to change your default application for opening `jar` files.

Noted on the code ownership thing. Because of the OOP, a change somewhere may require changes in quite a number of files so I was concerned about the Git blame; it's easier to trace to know who to ask for help. I suppose bug fixes don't really make that many changes so it should be ok. I'll continue with patches where convenient.

Can I check if my reasoning is correct:
The client constructor is still in use and hasn't been returned throughout the time init is called so the activation bar for init is within the activation bar for the client constructor
But for the add and set methods, their execution is separate. Since the activation bar should be unbroken until the method is returned, once one method returns, the activation bar can be broken and a new one is created for the other method

Try putting the start method in another class Main.java and Application.launch(Main.class, args); in another class Launcher.java. Also, once you do this, keep Main.class as the first argument of Application.launch(Main.class, args);, don't change in to Duke.class

I think it's better to go with option 2 so that you can meet Level 8's requirements of using LocalDate or LocalDateTime to store dates. I did a similar thing as well - I only accepted dates of a certain format and an invalid format or empty description  would throw an exception. 

Even if you go with option 1 and accept strings like "tomorrow" or "next week" then parse them into LocalDate or LocalDateTime), I think it would be too many variations of strings to parse.

Hi, when drawing sequence diagrams, it is mentioned that

However, if we are calling a method of `Model` class which uses a parameter of `Model` class, what are some rules we should follow?
e.g. do we need to add use the `<<class>>` notation, and do we need to underline the static variable?

However, for my implementation I still used named constants because I may want to change the content of user feedback messages as I give my bot more personality in the future, and in this case the messages may not be that descriptive? Also I feel that it makes my code more "organized" especially when the messages get longer and I'd rather prefer defining it beforehand, and use a short constant name within each method.

I think the question here is to achieve `100% path overage`. The number of paths through the loop is very large, as each possible length of `s` produces a unique path. 

So in your example `s = null` and `s.length() = 1` will not cover 100% path coverage as the path of iterating two times is not covererd.

If I'm understanding correctly, the difference is that
- `padding` is when you are confident that you need 3 days, but you still add 2 extra days to the deliverable deadline. (You do not need these 2 days)
- `buffer` is when you estimate that you need 3 days based on current information, but you add 2 extra days to absorb any unforeseen delays. (You do need these 2 days as effort/time estimations are hard in this case)

where you instead throw the duke exception, shouldn't the duke exception only be used for custom and special scenarios? 
Also in the picture above, if im not wrong, the tasks = new TaskList(); is for when the chatbot is newly created and the data file has yet to been created, however why is it in the catch block instead and also alongside a Ui showing error when it's not really an error? Wouldn't an if-else statement be more suitable for such control flows? Thank you for answering my questions

Thanks all, I think I agree that the exceptions such as file not found should be directly handled in storage class instead for abstraction purposes and also agree with @SherisseTJW with creating multiple exception classes for clarity and @jeremiahlzz in that adding a custom exception adds a layer of complexity if it does not do anything different and thank you prof @damithc  for the excellent answer!

Hi, I would like to ask if anyone received this message at the end of using `./gradlew clean build` or `./gradlew run`?

```
Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

See https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.2/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings
```

Was wondering if this would affect future requirements and how did this come about as I don't recall changing the version of gradlew

Hi, 
Judging from your code, you seem to be iterating through your list and rewriting to FILE, which would lead to multiple overwriting of a single task. 
If that is the case, you can create a FileWriter object that appends to the file (instead of overwriting the current content) by specifying an additional boolean parameter to the constructor.
For Example: `FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(FILE, true); ` 

I would also suggest wrapping your code in a code block and also providing other useful information to help with debugging this issue such as `FILE`, `createFile()` etc.

This issue might be due to your gradle task configurations:
Make sure that the mainClass in your build.gradle file is correctly set to the main class where your main method is located. 

```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("<your_main_class>")
``}``

Hi, Git is a distributed version control system that enables us to have multiple local copies of the project's codebase independent of each other.

1) You could try reinstalling Inteliij for a start
2) to set `JAVA_HOME` for mac: open terminal and enter `vim ~/.zshrc` or `vim ~/.bash_profile`, depending on if you're using zsh or bash. Then, add in the follow line: `export JAVA_HOME=\$(/usr/libexec/java_home)`.

The CI tools will not allow you to create the pull request if your current PR does not pass CI tests.
To solve this, you can take a look at the logs in the build to see which part of your code is causing the tests to fail; it would most likely be due to some checkstyle!

@damithc CI passes , so this is a local issue.
I have tried all the following suggestions:
* Run `./gradlew clean build`
* Choose `File` -&gt; `Invalidate caches`
* Close Intellij -&gt; Delete the `.idea` folder -&gt; Re open the project in Intellij
* Clone the fork to a different location and open the project in Intellij again to get a fresh start without losing changes you did so far.

But unfortunately, none of them works for me

It started happening today. No noticeable changes, I pulled in 2 simple commits from the upstream repo and created a branch to work on my feature fixes.
This problem then started.

I tried `./gradlew clean test` and `./gradlew clean build` in the IntelliJ terminal just now, and it led to the same error.

However, upon running tests both commands in a terminal **(outside of Intellij)**, I am able to get a build successfully message.

This means there is something wrong with Intellij....

A tester raised an [issue](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/issues/179) regarding the program doing nothing when it takes in garbage values, which in this case is a start date being later than an end date.
I had written an unique class exception 'InvalidDatesException' for this and thrown this exception. However, it turns out that the code will only display error messages related to parse exceptions, so the command with garbage values will be rejected, but the error message will not be shown.

To fix this, I added this chunk of code 
' catch (InvalidDatesException x) ``{``
            throw new ParseException(x.getMessage());``}``'
But my team worries that this may count as enhancement, and therefore violate the feature freeze. To add on, the user can currently tell that the command does not work as nothing happens when they enter the garbage command.

Hi,

Our team has a few fields (e.g. name, remark) that disallow certain characters e.g. `/` that makes the command harder to parse, however this has inevitably introduced feature flaws due to the inflexibility of the user input validation.

We wish to address this issue by including it the "Planned Enchancement" section of our DG, however we are wondering if we are allowed to combine all affected fields into a single enhancement. We would also like to ask how specific must we go into the implementation for this enhancement,  i.e. would "Allow users to enter special characters into these fields" be sufficient for our proposed solution?

Hi, our team would like to ask if the following bug report will be considered a bug w.r.t [Q8](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#:~:text=of%20a%20feature%3F-,Q8,-%3A%20A%20UI) of the bugs FAQ:
>  Only if the behavior hinders normal usage i.e., the user not being able to see the full text in any way can be considered an 'incorrect' behavior, and hence, a bug.

The tester has reported that the help window is too large and cannot be resized, causing the window navigation buttons to not appear on the tester's screen (i.e. cannot close/minimise window). Would this translate to a bug as it hinders normal usage (potential bug fix would be to set the window to resizable), or would it be considered as feature flaw?

Hi,

Suppose we have a parameter `ADDRESS` that takes in any valid local home address, however this is not explicitly stated in the UG. The UG only states the valid character set for this parameter.

Certain edge cases such as `ADDRESS` with `@` character was not thought of during implementation, thus it would result in an error in such instances. I would like to clarify is this considered as a feature flaw, or can we treat this as a functionality bug.

If it is a feature flaw, then would it be best to clearly the definition of this parameter in the UG and add this edge case as a "Planned Enhancement"? Thank you!

OR

A contact can be associated to zero or more meeting object that consists of details (e.g. datetime, location, etc.)

    mainClass.set("pingmebot.Pingme")

Hi Prof @damithc, just wanted to elaborate on my query. For the sequence diagram below, each field in a `Person` class would have its own `Predicate` class, e.g. `NameContainsKeywordPredicate`, that implements `Predicate<Person>`. I am not sure if it would be better to omit the `NameContainsKeywordPredicate()` method call as I want to generalise the sequence diagram for it to be applicable for all `Person` fields. But at the same time, omitting this method call might make it slightly unclear as how the parameter value, `John Doe`, is passed to the predicate.

Hi Prof @damithc , thank you for your reply. We would like to ask a follow up question whether the fix here refers to changes in the code base?

For example, if we would like to add more `DateTime` and `Date` formats as one of our "Planned Enhancement", can we combine the `Date` and `DateTime` enhancements as the `Date` and `DateTime` are **tied together implicitly**.  For instance, `DateTime` is used for our schedule command which is to schedule meeting at a certain datetime. Our find command allows us to find a meeting by a specific date. If we change the format for `DateTime` to relax the inputs, can we add the changing of the `Date` format together as one enhancement?

On a seperate note, would it be considered if `NotInScope` if we have clearly stated the `Date` and `DateTime` format restriction in our UG but a tester later reports to lack of multiple `Date` and `DateTime` formats during PE? i.e. our application only support `dd-MM-yyyy` format but tester wants `d-M-yyyy` format to be accepted as well.

Thank you!

I get that after you create a branch and try to merge the branch back to master, you should push both the master and the branch. 
My question is, whenever you create a new branch and repeat the process above, do you need to push all the created branches so far, even including the ones not relevant in this specific merge?

I've  initialized the tasks ArrayList as follows: `ArrayList<Task> tasks = new ArrayList<>();`

```
else if (input.startsWith("delete")) ``{``
                    if (input.length() <= 7) ``{``
                        throw new DukeException("Please state the index of the task you want to delete with correct spacing" +
                                " (e.g. delete 3)");
                    ``}``

                    Integer indexOfTask = Integer.parseInt(input.substring(7).trim()) - 1;

                    if (indexOfTask < 0 || indexOfTask >= tasks.size()) ``{``
                        throw new DukeException("The task index is out of range.");
                    ``}``

                    Task removedTask = tasks.get(indexOfTask);
                    System.out.println("Noted. I've removed this task: \n" + removedTask);

                    tasks.remove(indexOfTask);
                    System.out.println("Now you have " + tasks.size() + " tasks in the list.");
                ``}``
```

When I add in the tasks and then use the delete command, it does correctly give back the removed task, but it doesn't update the total number of remaining tasks.

May I know why the remove method isn't modifying the task ArrayList?

Hence, your local `branch-A-CodeQuality` is behind `origin/branch-A-CodeQuality`

Thanks for the guidance!
I've fetched the remote CQ branch into my local CQ branch, then merged the CQ branch to master like the following:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/109773933/a0b7bc4a-f0a0-4dd9-b2bd-127046d07ba2)
Unfortunately, I couldn't do the PR method for CQ branch, but I've managed to push all the changes to origin/master.

Just for future reference, may I know what was the reason why the master branch was merged into CQ branch? For PR for CQ branch, I did correctly direct the PR route from local CQ branch to local master branch. There was a merge conflict, so I manually resolved the conflicting code in github web browser and confirmed merge. Then I pulled the merged status of remote repo back into my local master, but I faced the issue above (PR merge strangely not performed although checked, CQ branch merged into master).

> 
> @jeong-jaeho Doing this kind of changes on the GitHub UI results in extra commits/merges. In this case, it resulted in the master branch being merged to your CQ branch. For beginners, it is best not to resolve conflicts or update branches using GitHub UI as don't get to see what's happening on the Git side when you do something using GitHub UI, resulting in this kind of 'mystery' changes to your fork.

By the way, I've pushed the CQ branch without PR merging, unlike how I followed proper PR merging for Assertions branch. Will this lose marks in "Followed other requirements specified (e.g., how to use Git/GitHub for each increment, do peer reviews) in at least 4 weeks"?

@damithc Since the tutorial is due today before today's briefing, I've pushed my current changes to my fork and created a PR to the team repo for now. I'm trying to resolve the compilation errors and planning to commit the fix and then close the PR. In the event that I cannot resolve the issues, does it meet the requirements by creating an unfinished PR that has unsuccessful check status..?

@damithc Prof, I was wondering if it is okay if I pull from the main tp remote repo by creating a new commit even if fast-forward is possible as the following using SourceTree:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/109773933/6b8d2416-33fa-470a-94ec-f4409d095378)

I remember that we were told to create a new commit and not do fast-forward for merging, but looking back, not sure if we are recommended to do this for pulling. I remember that using just the CLI pulling method using 'git pull (remote repo) master' doesn't create a new commit and shows as a single connected branch between team repo and my own forked repo. On the contrary, creating a new commit even if fast-forward using SourceTree looks as the following after I've pulled the updates on main repo and pushed the changes to my own forked repo:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/109773933/80ed703a-b7f4-4e4d-b979-257995a6f06a)

@damithc Prof, I didn't revert from the wrong forking flow as you suggested, and I just pulled the newly merged PR my team mate made using 'git pull (remote team repo) master' in CLI instead of using SourceTree. 
![스크린샷 2024-03-14 212652](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/109773933/a93eb061-1895-42fc-b3a3-bb06301ee016)

However, it seems that it's not following the normal forking flow since origin/master and tp/master are not in a contiguous branch. I'm assuming the previous wrong forking flow is causing a new merge to be made each time..? 
I didn't push the pulled changes into origin/master yet just in case. 
Or am I wrong, and it is indeed going back to proper forking flow when I push the pulled changes?

Is it okay to delete my current tp forked repo from my github repository, fork the team tp repo into my own repo again, and start again with the correct forking flow? Would all my previous work be still recognized by the system when tracking?

@damithc Is it that EPs need to follow the input param's type? For example, the reason why 'all non int values' isn't accepted is because type 'int' can only accept test cases that can be substituted into the type 'int'.

Since the second example's input type is String, it can accept all types of strings and also 'null'?

If an object is initially declared as type "Object" and instantiated as "Task" for example from iP. If you go to print the object, the toString() method from Task class is run, rather than the base toString() from Object class. This method resolution for overriden methods happens at runtime.

## Problem
As I am a Mac user with M1 core, my `.jar` file runs fine on my friend's MacBook (M1) but not my other friends MacBook (Intel), and it doesn't run on 4/4 of my friends' Windows (Intel).

## How I fixed it.
Following #241 , I moved my `Launcher.java` from `src/java/kbot/gui` to  `src/java/kbot` as shown below after the change. Furthermore, I renamed my original file containing the `start()` method for the Application from `KBot.java` to `Main.java`.

## Question
So, at this moment, since I made the changes in a single commit, I do not understand what exactly made my jar file work. And I am seeking to clarify why my original program works for M1 Mac users but not for Intel users whereas the fix made it work on all devices.

Sorry, Im not exactly sure how the discussion here answers my concern about the error. 

>The reason is that the Java 11 runtime will check if the main class extends javafx.application.Application, and if that is the case, it strongly requires the javafx platform to be available as a module, and not as a jar for example.

What I gather from this is that the JavaFX module has to be present within the user's computer and that the main class has to extend Application, which were steps I took. Maybe you can help me draw the link here? Appreciate the help!

I believe that if you import java.util.Date and also have your own Date class in the same file, the compiler will use your local version of Date.

From what I gathered online and from gpt, instance (non-static) implementation allows for polymorphism and dynamic binding, whereas a static implementaion does allow for that, you could implement child classes that has the same static method, but you cannot "override" the parent method, which is not as OO as an instance implementation.

For instance, if you have different types of parsers or user interfaces, using instance methods allows you to define a common interface or base class and then provide specific implementations for each variant. This way, you can easily switch between different parsers or UIs at runtime, depending on the context or configuration, without changing the underlying system architecture.

Hope this makes sense.

In Week 6 topic, we are introduced to sequence diagrams. Among that there are something called alternative paths and optional paths, as shown below:

My questions are:
1. Are they actually the same thing except that alternative paths **must have more than one** conditions (paths), and optional paths **must have only one** condition (path)?
2. Is there any rule related to whether the [condition] should be written on the left or right of the first activation bar (refer to the examples for alt and opt above)?

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: In-video quiz bug**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/320" expanded>

Some content videos will include quizzes (indicated with Q+ as shown below), which will stop the video progress automatically and pop out a quiz window. The video progress will be resumed only after users answer the quizzes.
<img width="180" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 1 17 00 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/102943362/d87cfe5b-f51f-4f53-abd4-b549987fd82e">

It is possible that the video progress is resumed without user answering the quizzes (I'm not sure with the trigger mechanism yet, but sometimes it happens when I refresh the page or long time inactive). When this happens, and when the second quiz comes (most of the videos have multiple in-video quizzes), even the user answered the second quiz, the video will not proceed because the system somehow detected that the first quiz is not answered.

When I encounter this bug, my solution is to drag the video progress bar to an earlier timing, so that the first quiz comes again, and I can answer it properly.

I understand that this bug is hard to replicated as the trigger mechanism is not cleared (from me) yet. If anyone has also faced this problem too, I hope my solution can help you, and please share your trigger mechanism too.

Thank you!

In the Java coding standard guide provided below, we are encouraged to initialise variables with some values when we declare them.

<img width="992" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 1 08 47 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/102943362/3a243b2c-c529-4c88-968b-7d2260f554ee">

But in some cases such as follows:
```Java
int a = 0;
if (condition) ``{``
    a = 1;
``}`` else ``{``
    a = 2;
``}``
System.out.println(a);
```

Regardless of the initialised value of the variable `a`, it will be overwritten in the if block, so is it still necessary to initialise `a` with some value?

<panel  header="**5. :fas-info-circle: Navigation Bar Bug for Mobile Device**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/318" expanded>

In our course website, usually the navigation bar for weekly schedule looks like below, where each component is clickable and each of them leads to different pages.

<img width="813" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 12 58 40 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/102943362/9877aaa6-51a2-4bd6-a7df-58ea75f6a2f3">

However, when the course website is accessed via mobile device (e.g. phone), sometimes part of the navigation bar is truncated, and it is not scrollable to access the remaining components. A demonstration of the scenario is shown below:

<img width="327" alt="Screenshot 2024-02-19 at 1 00 23 AM" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/102943362/789c5509-b63d-49cf-9974-12ffd21b995d">

I suspect that this is due to the style setting (not sure the tech stack used is CSS or anything else) of the navigation bar, where the device's screen width is not sufficient to handle the width of navigation bar. Of course, it is possible that there is a way to access other components that I'm not aware of (except ticking the desktop site selection), please teach me the way in that case. Thank you!

I tried the given command, but it requires me to give a tagging message. After further research on https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging, looks like we can either make **lightweight** or **annotated** tags.

For **lightweight** tags:
git tag ``{``tagname``}``

For **annotated** tags:
git tag -a ``{``tagname``}`` -m ``{``tagging message``}``

I raise this issue to ask whether we need to specify tagging message when creating tag, and also highlight the attention of the teaching team if any rectification on the given material is required.

Without ticking the desktop site selection, I can't zoom out more, and zoom in doesn't show the missing part either.

When I rotate the phone to landscape mode, the missing parts are indeed visible. My concern is this may be a coincidence for my device due to my screen's length, but it may not work for other devices that have shorter screen length.

Personally I'm also having doubt when doing this question, as the textbook only mentioned "Use enumerations when a certain variable can take only **a small number of finite values.**"

How do we define **small** in this case? 10001 is considered small compared to the `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. In the case, if I created an enumeration that takes values `ZERO`, `ONE`, `TWO`, ... , `TEN THOUSAND`, is it acceptable?

I agree with @bgopi23. To add on, I think it will be visually **repetitive** as a similar chunk of codes exists as multiple copies in the file (with minor changes), so it will be good if you can "abstract" their similarities out.

Hi, in my opinion, if `doMoreStuff()` is meant to be a general function that can be used by a number of methods, it will indeed be good to let it be less restrictive. On the other hand, if `doMoreStuff()` is a private helper method only for `doSomething()`, then it make sense to let it be restrictive in order to maintain the single layer of abstraction in `doSomething()`.

As an alternative, perhaps you can use `class B`, but add another function called `doMoreStuffIfNotB()`. E.g.
```java
void doMoreStuffIfNotB(boolean b) ``{``
    if (!b) ``{``
       // ...
    ``}``
``}``
```

Then any method that needs them, e.g. `doSomething()` can do:
```java
void doSomething(boolean b) ``{``
   doStuff();
   doMoreStuffIfB(b);
   doMoreStuffIfNotB(b);
``}``
```

Hi, I agree with @AidenLYT. For me, sometimes I faced a bug and I just want to have a quick peek on what's the value that a variable holding at a certain line of code. In this case, the first thing that comes to my mind is `System.out.println(variable)`.

I find logging to have similar usage, and it can be used in projects to maintain long-term sustainability.

Just to share some similar feeling on the complicated tests:

For me, I was really overwhelmed by how the various components of the AB3 main code worked at first, and it took me a few weeks to get used to it. After I wrote my first code increment, I realized that I also needed to write test cases for the new stuff I had added. I found out that the test functions were formed by complicated various components as well, but I couldn't afford to spend another few weeks understanding everything in tests just because I wanted to make the code increment.

I believe it would be beneficial if a better guide were given to students to get used to the codebase structure and understand why every class is necessary. It also happened a few times that I made some changes in the code, but unexpected errors occurred just because I wasn't familiar with the other part of the code that used the code that I edited.

For me, I usually read through all the code and try to understand why the code was added. I seek clarification from the teammate who made the change before approval.

Although this workflow may take some time, I believe it is worthwhile as it reduces the chance of introducing bugs and potential risks of failure.

As a side note, I prefer not to "stack" multiple changes into a single pull request. It takes the reviewer more time to understand the changes, or may encourage them to simply LGTM without thorough review, thereby increasing the vulnerability of the codebase.

I am not sure but I don't think you need to delete the old tags. The system should look for the right ones.

For the jar part, the page updates daily. If it has not turned green, it might simply mean you have to wait for the next time the system checks your work. 

you git standard component is red because your commit subject messages are not correct. This tag tracks your last 5 git commits. As long as the standard is followed it will turn green.  It should become green once you do them correctly.

`&lt;type>[optional scope]: &lt;description>`, the type is specified in lower case. I thought that this additional convention of git commit messages is more organised and succinct.

2) Could you describe your typical workflow in submitting/accepting PRs? 
3) Is it necessary to pull our peer's PR and ensure everything runs well before approving? 

My group has decided on our general workflow to be: 
PR from individual fork to project's master branch -&gt; all members look through PR -&gt; (unsure if need to pull PR code and test) -&gt; approve and merge when no visible issues

Hello, in this weeks topic we learnt that two unidirectional associations in opposite directions do not add up to a single bidirectional association.
"In the code below, there is a bidirectional association between the Person class and the Cat class i.e., if Person p is the owner of the Cat c, p it will result in p and c having references to each other."

```
class Person ``{``
    Cat pet;
    //...
``}``

class Cat``{``
    Person owner;
    //...
``}``

```
"The code below has two unidirectional associations between the Person class and the Cat class (in opposite directions) because the breeder is not necessarily the same person keeping the cat as a pet i.e., there are two separate associations here, which rules out it being a bidirectional association."
```
class Person ``{``
    Cat pet;
    //...
``}``

class Cat``{``
    Person breeder;
    //...
``}``
```

Just to confirm/clarify a few things:
- In terms of the way our code is implemented, there is no difference between the 2, ie the code is essentially identical other than the variable names. The main point of this example is just to highlight there may be a difference in how our code is **intended** on being used. The semantics of these relationships would then influence the way we should model them in a class diagram.
- Building from this example, assume that we want Cats to have both breeder and owner attributes, and a Person may be a breeder (no Breeder class) and owner. Should we use 3 different association lines between Person and Cat class to represent a owner-pet association (1 bidirectional arrow) and a breeder-animal association (2 unidirectional arrows)?

<panel  header="**7. :fas-info-circle: How to appropriately refactor code in A-MoreOOP**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/126" expanded>


When refactoring our code to achieve A-MoreOOP, we had to create many new classes and integrate them into the main logic of our program. I realised that as I started refactoring it, creating new classes, it kind of depended on other new classes as well and my entire code broke until i successfully finished refactoring the code in all (old and new) classes. 

As a result, this was just one commit with many many changes. I feel like this is not the "correct" way to do it but i am not sure. Should we be instead creating classes one by one and integrating it into our main code? However, I think this would also have a lot of unnecessary refactoring as you go through each iteration.

**TLDR:**
1. What are the best practices for managing dependencies and smoothly integrating new classes with existing ones during a refactor, to keep the codebase functional throughout the process

2. In this (depth-first?) refactoring approach where new dependencies are introduced, is it advisable to commit changes even if the code is temporarily non-functional, or should commits only be made once the code is stable?

Hi everyone, 

Thank you for all your valuable insights. 

I just did a quick summary of the key takeaways from this discussion:

**Modular Integration**: Adopt a module-by-module approach to integration, as recommended by @tankh99 and @wilsonwid. This helps to isolate and debug issues more efficiently.

**Granular Commits:** Make smaller, more frequent commits. This ensures the codebase remains functional and facilitates easier debugging, as mentioned by @itstrueitstrueitsrealitsreal and @ys112.

**Planning and Visualization**: Before coding, plan out functionalities and their relationships. This approach, highlighted by @NeoHW and @qinxutan, provides a clear roadmap for refactoring. We can also draw high level diagrams and map out the various has-a, is-a relationships between the classes as suggested by @appleraincoat and @UdhayaShan1 

Maintain Functional Code: Aim to keep the codebase functional at every step of the refactoring process, as emphasized by @sun-ruiheng and @hjungwoo01.


TLDR: Best practices seem to include modular integration, making step-by-step commits, strategic planning, while maintaining functional code. 

Thanks everyone for the collective wisdom! I'll be marking this issue as resolved.

Hi @dillontkh, thanks for your reply. According to Topic W4.2, "Note that two unidirectional associations in opposite directions do not add up to a single bidirectional association." 

To better describe the example given to us in the notes, a bidirectional arrow can be used to represent the owner-pet association because in the pet's owner's pet should be the same Cat, and an owner's pet's owner should be the same Person. On the other hand, we use 2 single unidirectional arrows to portray the breeder-kitten association because multiple Cats can have the same owner, while a owner can have multiple Cats. 

I think another example for 2 unidirectional arrows that do not equate to a single bidirectional arrow would be this: 
<img width="554" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/98398940/36ad5f00-b89b-4996-9e55-4db0b9984c37">
In this case, Male has a 'mother' attribute to store a Female, while Female has a 'husband' attribute to store a Male. However, they do not refer to the same instance and hence should not be one bidirectional navigability

Feel free to correct me if I have made any misconceptions.

Hello everyone, I came up with 2 possible representations:
1. Model the breeder-kitten association with 2 unidirectional arrows:
<img width="580" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/98398940/a2362c25-044e-4242-a222-038eda6ab0a6">

or 

2. Model the breeder-kitten association with 1 bidirectional arrows: 
<img width="828" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/98398940/211c9e03-34c0-4d20-9a9d-7b1f3c37e109">

After some offline discussion, I think that if we wanted to keep track of the animals a breeder bred, and the breeder of the Cat, we should model it in 1 bidirectional arrow, with the multiplicities at both side, if would encapsulate what we want to represent. 

Please feel free to share your thoughts on this :)

I think that GPT4 is really useful in helping you phrase your user stories in TP. I think that the bulk of the ideation should still be done by your team, for reliability and for your team to come to the same consensus. However, after getting the rough ideas behind each user story, GPT4 can nicely refine your idea into the User Story format:
`As a ``{``user type/role``}`` I can ``{``function``}`` so that ``{``benefit``}```

This was especially useful for my team in building our developer guide since I could use GPT to output the user stories in the md table format too.

Thanks Prof for the alternative perspective!

Option 1 it seems like it is late-and-one-time but incremental:
- Late and one time: involves a single phase of integration just before delivery.
- Components are still integrated one by one in a sequence, allowing for testing and issue resolution at each step (albeit might be rushed).

Option 2 seems like it is early-and-frequent but is always a new "big bang" at every iteration:
- Integration happens at the end of each month, allowing for frequent testing and issue resolution.
- At every iteration, this approach still involves integrating all new components and code together before testing.

Hi, as per the Title, I am wondering what is the intended purpose of the Implementation Section in the DG? 

This question is two-fold:
1. What is the actual purpose? (I couldn't really find any specific details in the Website now that I go check again)
2. How do I handle my bug report rejected?

I was under the impression that it is used to go through the Implementation Details of **existing** features which have already been implemented, and not to cover the Proposed Implementation Details of **proposed** additional features. 

To provide context as to this question, there is a bug report I submitted for which the Implementation Section only contained details of **proposed** additional features (which are also not in the Planned Enhancements section although they are in the Future Updates section of the UG). In my bug report, I suggested that they be removed as it may confuse the user (due to my original impression of the section's purpose)

However, the team rejected the bug report, stating that the section is for Features which do not yet exist in the application. (Although, they somehow accepted another of my bug report which suggested that they add details of existing features)

However, if hypothetically, we did introduce checks for said fields, just that they did not work correctly, then we are allowed to fix said validity check.

I think the Prof. has answered your main question quite well, just some extra input from me as to custom exception handling since I also noticed this when I was doing the PR Review.

Personally, I prefer having multiple custom Exception classes (i.e., `InvalidCommandException`, `InvalidArgumentsException`) so that I can distinguish the different scenarios rather than having a simple catch-all `DukeException` class. This also allows you to define specific formats for the messages so that it is clearly standardised without having to copy paste the error message string multiple times.

Quick Example: 
```
public class InvalidCommandException extends Exception ``{``
        public InvalidCommandException(String invalidCommand) ``{``
            super("Invalid Command: " + invalidCommand + " received.\nOnly the following commands are accepted: list, add, bye";
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I feel that "It changes the external behaviour" would be more appropriate actually. 

While refactoring is changing the **internal structure**, there is always the possibility of side-effects where it changes the **internal behaviour**, but we still consider it as refactoring

## Grammatical errors in output messages for certain inputs
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/84035425/8a340f83-997e-4090-972e-015a2df97868)

In the first image, the message should be "Added 1 point to Alex Yeoh". Can this be fixed in v1.4?

## Editing sample data to be more like real-use
Our application is a loyalty program, it stores orders and points awarded for making these orders. Our sample data currently does not make sense (i.e Alex made an order for cupcakes, and should have been awarded 200 points, but he has 0 points.)

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/84035425/985492b0-dda0-4df3-86d4-4f5221ea9b82)

Can we change Alex's points to reflect the correct amount which is 200

## Fixing Integer overflow
Currently, if an entry in our address book has `2147483647 points`, trying to add 1 point to the member will result in no change to points, but also no error/success message. On the other hand, another field our app stores in the same situation results in the field changing from `2147483647` to `-2147483648`. Can we introduce a maximum points (i.e 2,000,000,000) to prevent these from happening? Or can we only list this behaviour in the UG and park this under planned enhancements?

## Side question
Extreme values unlikely to appear with normal use, such as a name that is 300 characters long, cannot be fully shown in the UI in any way. Would this be considered a feature flaw in the PE?

Hi, this question is related to OOP Design and I am not sure if it belongs in this course but I'll appreciate any help given.

In Week 3 iP project, there was a suggestion of the Duke, Ui, Parser and Storage class. It seemed like in the suggested implementations, instances of those classes were created. When I did it, I did not create an instance of those classes, rather I just implemented static methods that I call directly from other classes. 

My question is: In cases like this where multiple instances of a class are highly unlikely to be needed (Duke, Ui, Storage class), should we still (using Parser as an example):
1. create an instance of the class, and treat it as an object

```
public class Parser ``{``
     public void parse(String input) ``{``
         //Code to parse input
     ``}``
``}``

// In another class:
...
Parser p = new Parser();
p.parse(string);
...
```
2. Or just treat the whole class as an object and implement it using static methods?

```
public class Parser ``{``
     public static void parse(String input) ``{``
         //Code to parse input
     ``}``
``}``

// In another class:
...
Parser.parse(string);
...
```

@bgopi23 I encountered a similar issue hence ended up in this post, these are my personal findings

1) For Level-0, upon completing my requirements and staging my changes, I did the following:
`git push`
`git push --tags`
This resulted in normal behaviour without the error message.

2) For Level-1,  upon completing my requirements and staging my changes, I did the following:
`git push --tags`
This resulted me in getting the same error as you did (Sorry forgot to screenshot)
Then, as suggested by prof @damithc, I did
`git push`
Which fixed the problem upon refreshing my github page

I suspect that you, like me, are doing `git push --tags`, thinking that this pushes both commits and tags but in reality it only pushes tags. Even though you can see the changes in the code from the tag, I think (correct me if I'm wrong) that its not how version control is meant to be done. From what you have described, it sounds like you have already done multiple "Levels" this way and I'm not sure how you can resolve it from there.

Maybe you can do the following (Someone else please advise if this is okay):
1. Delete all your tags on github and local repo
2. Do `git push` to push all your commits for the levels you have done
3. Tag all the levels you have done (on local repo)
4. Do `git push --tags` to push all the tags

I came up with this suggestion based on this FAQ on the website

From the PE readiness quiz, it seems that the user setting a duplicate entry in the address book through the CLI is considered a Severity.High bug when it causes the address book to be cleared:

Will non-CLI forms of user corruption of the data causing the address book to be cleared also be considered Severity.High bugs? For instance, let's say the user edits a name in the JSON file causing it to be a duplicate of another name, and the team has implemented the AB3 to detect this on startup and start with an empty address book (thus deleting all the data). Is this not a bug, a lower severity bug, or still a Severity.High bug (since the outcome is still "disastrous" but was intended by the team)?

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: Incorrect value displayed - should the success message or the logic of the code be changed?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/818" expanded>

Hi Prof @damithc, we are considering two approaches to modifying a problematic behaviour in our app and would like to see whether either/both of them are allowed.

- Currently, two of our commands (`linkloan` and `editloan`) allow passing in of a monetary value (the loan value) as a parameter.
- In our v1.3 UG, it was stated for `linkloan` that the loan value must be (up) to 2d.p., following the general consensus that money should be to at most 2 decimal places. However, we missed out including this for `editloan` (bug in the UG). It must be noted that it does not make much sense for `linkloan` to disallow > 2d.p. but `editloan` to allow it.
- Right now our `linkloan` command is erroneously able to accept > 2d.p. values. The > 2d.p. values are accepted by the app and stored correctly, and displayed correctly when a user accesses the loan. This bug was reported by testers in v1.3 due to its difference from the UG.
- However, the success message displays the loan to only 2d.p. (i.e rounds it off) as we implemented the success message to show 2d.p. values, since it was intended for only 2d.p. values to be accepted. For instance, a loan of `0.0001` would be displayed as `0.00` in the success message. Therefore, this might fall under _incorrect results_ in Q5 of the FAQs for the feature freeze, since the value displayed in the success message is not the value the user entered.

Which of these two lines of thinking would be allowed to approach the issue while maintaining adherence to the feature freeze?

1.  The issue is in the `linkloan` command being to accept 2d.p. values, since our v1.3 user guide says it doesn't. We should modify our `linkloan` (and possibly by extension, `editloan`?) command(s) to reject values that are more than 2d.p., upon which the success message will always be correct.
2. The issue is in the success message rounding the loan to 2d.p. We should modify the success message to allow it to show more than 2d.p. in the loan value, and edit the UG to remove the part saying the loan value must be (up) to 2d.p.

Here are some screenshots for reference:

Hi Prof @damithc , currently, our product allows users to enter only the start date and/or end date in yyyy-MM-dd when adding or editing a loan. However, when the loan is displayed the start and end time is displayed as well (due to a conversion issue) and is always set to midnight SGT. This time is not a property of the loan and it has never been intended for the loan to have a start and end time, as our commands only allow entering of the loan date. Would the display of the (default) time be considered a bug needing to be fixed?

When my friend and I were testing each other's iP implementations, I noticed a discrepancy in the way we handle our deadline tasks (implemented in Level 8). Normally, if a deadline is entered in a certain date format (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd), the chatbot is supposed to identify and convert the format. But what about deadlines which are not of this format (e.g. "tomorrow")? There are 2 possible approaches:

1. Accept the deadline as valid, and simply print out what the user has written in (e.g. [D][] submit CS2103T quiz (by: tomorrow))
2. Reject the deadline as invalid, and throw an exception (i.e. the chatbot informs the user that they _must_ enter a date)

Which of these situations would be accepted as valid in the context of this course?

In addition, I just realised that the display of the loan time might cause an inaccurate representation of the loan. For instance, a loan from `2024-01-01` to `2024-12-31` would be returned on time if it was returned on the last day. However, if the time was displayed, it would be `2024-01-01 00:00` to `2024-12-31 00:00`, so the user would think the loan was returned late if it was returned on `2024-12-31`, even though it was on time.

Hi Prof, thank you for the reply! We will adopt your guideline.

To summarise, here is what we will do:

- We will not make any further edits to the logic of how a loan value is handled, or the value displayed for a loan > 2d.p.
- We will update the UG to inform the user that if the loan has > 2d.p., the behaviour of the app will not be optimal. We will also include filtering out > 2d.p. values in the Planned Enhancements.

From my understanding, the repeatable objects will still exist.
For example, a repeatable object may be stored in multiple histories. It does not make sense that deleting a history will delete repeatable objects stored in other histories.

Another analogy would be Person objects stored inside a Queue object. The people would not be deleted if the Queue object is deleted.

> > From my understanding, SLAP requires that a method performs only a single task. It has nothing to do with how it is implemented.

> @logical-1985516 This is not correct. While each method should do only one thing, SLAP is not about that, and has everything to do with how the method is implemented. Did any of the course materials led you to the above incorrect conclusion (in which case we need to improve it)?

My bad with the phrasing. I misunderstood SLAP slightly and combined it with SRP. Perhaps I should have changed it to "tasks of similar complexity". For the implementation part, I was referring to this part:
> Throughout the method, it seems to be quite low level with print statements, for loops and variable definitions.

I meant that whether a method uses low level statements has nothing to do with the level of abstraction. After all, no matter the complexity of a method, it can always be broken down into low level code.

### Problem
If I follow JavaFX Tutorial, my GUI will only be able to response to the UserInput, but it cannot show the initial greeting when the app is open like in CLI UI.

Changing initialized() method in MainWindow class allow me to add a customized dialog box at the beginning:
``` java
@FXML
    public void initialize() ``{``
        scrollPane.vvalueProperty().bind(dialogContainer.heightProperty());
        dialogContainer.getChildren().add(
                DialogBox.getDukeDialog("Welcome", dukeImage)
        );
    ``}``
```
**However**, it will not work if i want to trigger a method from duke such as `duke.greeting()` instead of the static String.

> @vnnamng hmm... how did a revert of a PR caused changes to work done by others? Can you point to the commit in concern?

@damithc 
I think it is because the problem with the PR merged is improper track of the merge content, hence I have accidentally delete my teammates part, hence when revert, the readded content becomes mine.

Commit in concern:
https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F08-2/tp/commit/57a7fedcbc885d2b3ea733eaaf37c5f48e8243b1

Duke.java is the file that launches the GUI and duke is the package name so I tried:

Given this is the description for SUBJECT-GRADE:

* For SUBJECT-GRADE, the input must not contain special characters.
* Note: SUBJECT refers to the subject the student is receiving tuition for, while GRADE refers to the grade the student obtained for their most recent test on that subject.
* E.g. math-B indicates that the student is receiving tuition for Mathematics, and obtained a B grade for their most recent test for Mathematics.

User can only use specific letters as defined in the regex but maybe it should encompass more letters and numbers for international students as it was not mentioned.
Is this issue considered a bug or a feature flaw?

When I try to redo the steps of making the new jar file with IntelliJ/gradle from my duke.Launcher. I can't seem to make it run as it says: `no main manifest attribute`.

my jar file is running main from my `Launcher.java` file:
```
package duke;

import javafx.application.Application;


/**
 * A launcher class to workaround classpath issues.
 */
public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Application.launch(Main.class, args);
    ``}``
``}``
```


There is a MANIFEST.MF class
```
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Main-Class: duke.Launcher
```

and my `build.gradle` has
```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
``}``

```
I can run Launcher normally but not from the jar file. Any ideas why?

So I had to figure out how to fix the error. When I looked into it further, I found someone's solution was to add the MV options but so far it hasn't worked.

I have found out a way to ensure the availability of emotes. 

I have also encountered similar issues on emojis too (emojis not showing, just like above). I copied the emojis online and pasted it into the README.md, but it is not shown at all in the website!

The way I resolve this is by typing `:` into the markdown, and the list of available emojis will appear. As far as I concern, I still have not encountered any single case where the emojis disappear when using the method above.

Another thing worth noting is, even when the emoji is available on github, for example: 🖼️ (\:framed_picture), it might not appear on your website if you copied and pasted from online.
You can try this on your markdown
Using the `:` method: 🖼️

Might not be very relevant, but I think you can force reset your local machine master branch to local repo master branch by running below at command prompt.

To force a git pull of the master branch to your local master branch, you can use the following command:
git fetch origin master     # Fetches the latest changes from the remote master branch
git reset --hard origin/master  # Resets your local master branch to match the remote master branch

Might not be 100% accurate. 

I would say it depends on the context. If the object is a constant and is immutable (e.g. stub object, PI, Plank's Constant), then it definitely should be `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` since this constant is universal.

Therefore, it still depends on the context of your `logger` and `arrayOfStrings`.

I think for your question, the decision made in the end whether a bug is a duplicate or not will be decided by the prof/TA team.

Not sure whether you noticed this. To increase your chance to _win_ in the battle of "whether this is a duplication", there is a section for you to place down your reasonings why you deem your bug is different from others.

Personally, I think since the multiplicity is not stated, it could be any numbers, including 0. 

In this case, in the object diagram, we can interpretate as the chair object has 0 table object and table object has 0 chair object. Therefore, it is compliant.

Might be wrong tho.

From the answer we can see that, `ProgressWatcher` does not have `+update(int)` even it is implementing the `Watcher` interface.
However, ProgressWatcher is an abstract class, so it might be different.

Umm, you may say that.

Personally, I fell that another way to say it more accurately is, due to the creation of Client object `c` is later than Server object `s`, so it needs to be positioned lower than `s`.

If there are two object creations, let's say `a` and `b` where `a` is created before `b`, then it `b` shall be positioned lower than `a`.

The reason why `s` is positioned higher than `c` is because `s` already existed before `c` is created.

As a follow-up question, may I ask whether bug reports of type "the app does this, but it is not explicitly stated in the user guide" can be considered "not in scope" (assuming it can be replicated)? 
For example, "the application does allow duplicates of the same prefix in the input, but never explicitly says that it does this." when none of the features involve duplicates of a prefix.

Thank you for your reply. As the two pointers seem to only address the issue of missing feature, may I ask whether they still need to be satisfied in the cases where it's not about a 'missing' feature, but an 'existing' feature?  For example, for the first question, the reported flaw is about putting 'too little' restriction on the input. The current restrictions are specified in the UG.  And for the second question, the reported flaw is about the existing mechanism of "allowing multiple prefix", that is not explicitly documented.

If by "indexing" you mean "UC01" and so on, I would say the severity depends on the number of use cases you have, since the biggest benefit brought by indexing is the ease of organizing use cases when you have many of them.

Hello, looking at the bugs I had reported, there are few that I reported as separate bug reports (as they had distinct issues) but were caused by a root issue [in particular, being able to edit an item which breaks the other functions of the application].

The team decided to reject the bug reporting the root issue citing that it is an intended feature.

Would it be appropriate if I mention these other bug reports in my response to their rejection? Or if not, perhaps elaborate on the bugs caused by this root problem?

Hi! I'm also using Apple Silicon Mac.

If you are using IntelliJ, you could check under File > Project Structure > Project Settings > Project to ensure that the SDK is Java 11 (Mine is 11.0.19). 

Also if I recall, though I'm not too sure because this was a while ago, I did encounter a problem with JavaFX whereby I had to close IntelliJ and restart it.

Hi ruiheng, 

For myself I created an exit() method in my equivalent of the Duke class, that is called upon the keyword "bye". I forced the GUI to not close (when user tries to click "X" to close) unless the user's latest input is bye. I prompt the user to say bye using an Alert. 

It's definitely a roundabout way, and assumes the user manually terminated the program, but perhaps this could be an idea to consider. All the best!

I suppose that would be true if the original class diagram didn't have the navigability as well. But I guess since the original class diagram does have it, it would match better with the navigability instead of just solid lines.

* Do rejected bugs affect our accuracy as the tester? 
* What about bugs marked as notInScope/issueUnclear/rejected/cannotReproduce and we as tester try to argue against them? How does the outcome affect our accuracy?

Thank you!

Hi team, the information on the course website regarding the PE-D evaluation seem to conflict each other. The following image is displayed in step 4 under "start fixing PED bugs" here: [fix ped bugs](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#2-start-fixing-ped-bugs-before-the-tutorial)

However, the evaluation form and evaluation rubric here seems to specify another set(see screenshot below) of correspondance: [ped](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#1-attend-the-practical-exam-dry-run-during-the-weekly-briefing-on-fri-apr-5th-counted-for-participation)

I faced some problems with setting up Java FX, on Intellij and Windows laptop. I started out with the [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFx.html) given in the course website, and got the following error message:
```Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```
I naturally proceed to download java fx 17.0.10(I couldn't find 17.0.7 as specified) after modifying the dependency in build.gradle and after adding it to the project structure as per steps 1 and 2 of [this](https://javabook.bloomu.edu/setupjavafx.html#:~:text=Click%20on%20the%20File%20menu,button%20to%20complete%20the%20process.) guide, I still got the same error message. I couldn't execute step 3 since I couldn't find the VM option. I have already closed and restarted Intellij a couple of times but it still wouldn't work.

Anyone who faced a similar problem would like to share how they resolved it? Thanks!

Hi all,

I have been stuck on this section for quite a while. I understand that I have to write the expected input and output into their respective txt files. The guide stated we should use input/output redirection. However, I am not sure which folder to test from and what files to feed in(just Duke.java? Or all the .java files in the same folder?) I did not change the folder structure, so Duke is still in `./src/main/java` folder(wrt ip) and the scripts are in `./text-ui-test`. Their lowest common ancestor is the home folder. The app worked perfectly fine in CLI but this happened when I tried input/output redirection:

Generally, the design section is the first real content section(preceding that there's acknowledgements and setting up) of the DG. So it seems inappropriate to have sequence diagrams in the design section of the DG following the top-down approach, but is it considered a bug? Or is the top-down approach just a general guideline?

hi! thank you for opening up this discussion. regarding your questions,

1. my train of thoughts while doing the refactoring was to group the various methods in the classes (e.g. all the methods to deal with user inputs in a group, all the methods to save user inputs into the txt in a grp etc). there after i will figure out the relationship between these classes and their inheritance (eg todo inherits from tasks etc). i would say a large part of it was making the main class a class with the "summary" of "category" classes and methods! so i was working from small classes and then removing the methods from the main class and then working my way up.

2. i only made the commit till the code is completely functional! like the other classmate mentioned, it is so that it would be easy for me to revert back to my last commit should my next change not run.

hope this helps!

Hi everyone,

https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/issues/164

Regarding the above issue, the tester provided a very extreme input for the index field. Even though the app does not crash nor it corrupts the data, it does not provide the best error message for the user, and similar happens for negative index or 0. Whenever the user provides the number outside of integer range or negative number & 0 as an index, it raises an invalid command error as above. Thus, I want to clarify whether generic error message that does not specifically tell the user that the "negative" or "zero" index provided is invalid is part of the valid bug (and whether we need to deal with this as a valid bug for v1.4).

Thank you!!

Hi everyone,

This time I have question regarding the admin side. Yesterday I completed my Week 3 iP, but when I created my javadoc, level 9, coding standard branches and merged, I forgot to push the commit I made in those branches to remote repo before the merge happens so that even though my local repo shows history that I created respective branches, it does not show up on ip dashboard as I did not push it into my github. 

In this case, should I undo all of the merges I have done so far and redo the whole thing again, or is it okay to just keep those branches indicated on my local repo? Thank you very much!

Hi!

I have just submitted level 7, and found out that more than 1 required branch is created which I am not very sure why it is the case. Basically, what I did was as follows:

1. Used git command "git branch branch-level-7" in order to create the branch, then "git checkout branch-level-7" in order to move my head to the branch created.
2. Then I did some modifications, then did git commit to update my branch as usual through "git add -&gt; git commit -&gt; git push -u origin branch-level-7" in order to push my commit to the github.

Above two processes, however, somehow created two duplicate branch named branch-level-7 as shown by gitk:

Hi prof! Thank you so much for your clarification. If I understood that correctly, that means for the fields that might need longer than what Ui is able to display without possibility that the user sabotaging the app (e.g. job description or comments on individual candidates might need much more space to display than what our Ui is able to display at the moment) could be deemed as a bug to fix right?

Hi prof, thank you very much for your reply! To summarize, we are allowed to expand the error message (invalid command format or invalid index provided!) but not allowed to add more details on our error messages right (e.g. we are not allowed to add extra messages on message class and codes that detect the invalid indices in the respective parser classes).

Hello, while I was trying to make a JUnit test class for the Todo class, I could not instantiate a Todo class in the test method. I tried to delete the test folder and create it again, I also tried invalidating cache. IntelliJ tells me to move the Todo class from main to test. Any way to resolve this? Thank you in advance!

Tag is a one word allergy tag for the patient. Currently it doesn't have a limit in length. But if the word is too long, it will gets cut out by the UI with no way to see the full text. Can we change the length limit to the longest word in the world and recommend the users to use abbreviations when the word is very long?

Is it considered a bug to be fixed in v1.4 because "ic/NRIC (optional but at least specify one)" is a wrong instruction? If user follow this instruction and leave the ic/ field empty would make the command fail.

Hi Prof, our product has a UI feature, a Calendar view of all the appointments, which is not stated in the UG currently. It contains a clickable calendar and a timeline for the day. It basically just reflect all the changes made to the appointments. While the acutally feature is implemented before feature freezing, it is not included in the UG before the feature freezing, are we allowed to preserve that feature and add some description of it into UG in v1.4?

Another thing to check is that currently the calendar support change of date only by clicking the respective button, with no specific command to do so. Can we still keep that feature by claiming it is just a form of UI display, or the only option left is to remove that feature?

Here is a screen recording of the calendar in working:

Thank you for you responses @Jerome-j and @lokidoki102. However, in line with what prof mentioned about how the user might not have a "project root" when you send the project to them, since the relative file path (now ./data/duke.txt) lies in Duke.java and is not a user input, how then would I be able to get my runtest.bat to use ../src/main/java/data/duke.txt instead?

Besides, the current thread linked #134 seems to be dealing with not being able to create the file because the directory was not yet created. I have a different problem where the runtest.bat path to duke.txt is different from that of duke.java to duke.txt but I have to use the same file path string.

The problem is that I do not know where the test script sets the current directory to be, and also unsure if my implementation is incorrect, resulting in the test script failing but running it manually is fine.

I further suspect my flawed implementation because it doesn't seem like many have this issue.

For now, I temporarily created a folder called "data" and duplicated duke.txt inside of the test folder.

Hi, the below screenshot is a picture from one of the tutorial slides which states that because of the opt box, we may not need to run both set() and reset().
![telegram-cloud-photo-size-5-6120827910542703566-y](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/116061001/b7d3b1c4-96f3-413d-85fc-9b6d68d732cf)

However, in the screenshot of the textbook below, it is written that "it is acceptable for none of the alternative paths to be executed". This means that we do not really need opt box and alt alone will enable us to not need to run both set() and reset(). Is this a correct interpretation? I was slightly confused as it seems to differ from what was implied in the tutorial screenshot above.

Hi, in my team's implementation, we purposefully only allowed for one phone number as we felt that by allowing the users to add more than one phone number, it could be problematic as the users will now have to remember which phone number that is in use.
This intentional feature was already mentioned in the UG. 
 
However, we noted that in the guidelines, it was mentioned that: Phone number not allowed more than once, in which it would considered as a feature flaw. 

As such, I am hoping to seek clarifications on whether this will still be considered a feature flaw? Thank you!

I think its because this question is explicitly asking about the highlighted attribute `helpers`

If we think about the navigability of `helpers`, Mat would have a reference to Bot  but the same reference is not present for Bot so it cant be Mat &lt;--- Bot. I think due to the extra associations which are not highlighted it made it seem like there were bidirectionals or extra unidirectionals present.

I think for the diagram questions is more of true till proven false so if a diagram does not contradict the code exactly (like option a) it can be taken as correct

Not sure if it will be useful, but you could try:

1. Abstracting out each of the cases into a different method, especially if multiple cases share common code.
2. Abstract out the entire switch-case block into a method, that returns the result of the switch-case. In this way you would be able to end with a return statement within each case instead of a break statement, which allows you to possibly combine your code within that return statement (this would pair well with point 1)

For the 2nd CCD, I think you are misunderstanding the diagram, as it is not necessary to have 2 instances of the instructor. The `InstructorRole` and `CoordinatorRole` are classes, and new objects of these roles are created whenever there is a new instructor/coordinator added to a course. The person object is simply associated with these role objects, and the same person object is used if the person has multiple roles. An example of this can be seen on the bottom right (the one with no black background).

I believe this provides more flexibility as it allows for specific fields added to each role. An example is the `isPastCoord` in the 2nd diagram, and more can be added to either role classes if required.

I don't think one is "better" than the other, and either one can be used depending on whether you would like to model it focusing more on simplicity or flexibility.

Our application consists of functionality that requires the use of external csv files. We had done our own testing using text editors to create our csv files.

While there might be a bug present, without the use of Excel, it is likely that this the user would not have caused our app to misbehave.

Our group has a find feature that **works** but not as intended due to certain implementation flaws.

It dosen't crash the application when used but it does limit a crucial functionality of our application. Is this considered a bug that we can fix?

Under the details for 1.4 feature freeze, it is mentioned that no UI enhancements are allowed. But are we allowed to make changes to fix bugs such as text getting cut off due to misalignment or lack of space?

Our team is in the midst of adding a very large feature and we would like to work on this feature on a separate branch in totality before merging it to our master branch. 

Our planned workflow is to create a branch (branch_largeFeature) on our upstream repository and work on that branch using the forking workflow (i.e. pulling from this new upstream branch, making our own branches and local commits and making pull requests to said upstream branch) 

When that feature is completed, we will create a PR to merge branch_largeFeature into our master.

Should we proceed in this manner? Will this workflow cause any issues with grading scripts?

Hello, seems like I found the issue.

Under `TypicalPersons.java` in `seedu.address.testutil` on lines 48 and 49,

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/103935416/34b73d41-842e-4d05-9d52-ec56a370916d)

You initialised `IDA` with an invalid telegram handle `idaho`. Your validation code requires your telegram handles to start with `@` so this leads to an `IllegalArgumentException`.

I'm not extremely clear on this but I believe what ends up happening is that the TypicalPerson class does not get initialised properly, and any subsequent references to the static values of the class below 'IDA' results in the `NoClassDefFoundError` you see in your tests

Changing `idaho` to `@idaho` seems to stop all `NoClassDefFoundError` related testcases from failing. 

On a side note, I was able to trace down the source of the error by running the gradle test with `--info` which gave me this additional information.

In the question below, (b) is incorrect because 'only one class keeps track of the association'. Wanted to clarify that if there are fields of object types that are not instantiated yet (as seen in the Bot class), do we not need to draw association lines? Seems counterintuitive though, cause in any method in the class, it might potentially be instantiated?

Hi Prof! Sorry for the ambiguity, I meant that it might possibly be instantiated within the init() method (since the method implementation is not shown, we don't know).

But regardless of this actually, I guess my question would be - if a field is not instantiated, we do not have to draw the association lines for it?

Hi @damithc and rest, 
As Ethan mentioned, I wanted to clarify if the lines between Section and Handout are right this way. Handout knows about Section and there is an obvious association, but Section has Handout as one of its parameters so there is a dependency. The association doesn't guarantee this dependency as by definition, so Section would still not be aware of Handout (without the dotted lines). Hence, is it right to do it this way?

Let feature X be a must have feature.
Let feature Y be a nice to have feature.

- Case 1: The application has feature X, however it would be a quality of life improvement if enhancement/feature Z is implemented. Can we report the absence of Z as a feature flaw?
- Case 2: If the application does not support feature Y. Can we report the lack of support for Y as a feature flaw?
- Case 3: If the application does not support feature X. I think in this case the lack of support for X is definitely a feature flaw.

From my understanding, since we have already mentioned that our tech stack parser should accept any inputs with '_', adjusting the regex should be considered a bug fix as our parser incorrectly blocked a legitimate input due to an incorrect regex. Could I ask if this is the correct understanding? Thanks in advance!

Will making adjustments to allow for names with special characters be considered an enhancement or bug fix? My understanding would be an enhancement, maybe the user can circumvent this issue (albeit with minor inconveniences) by not entering the special characters / replacing them with another character.

Hi profs and fellow classmates,

Referring to this issue, 
https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/149

Can I clarify if this is a bug or an enhancement? From my understanding, as per the website: 
"Accepting seemingly 'unsuitable' values for an input (e.g., accepting numbers for a person name, empty value as a parameter):
This is not considered 'incorrect' (giving more freedom to the user is not necessarily incorrect) unless those unsuitable values causes the application to misbehave."
- From this line of argument, it seems that allowing the user to input the same tech stack but in different cases is an enhancement. May I ask if this is the correct understanding, and if so should this be included in the Planned Enhancement section? Thanks in advance!

Yep i think your reasoning is correct. Basically the constructor for Client only returns after the execution of `s.set(port)`, hence the activation bar remains unbroken until the 2 parallel-executed methods return. 
The reason why init is within the constructor activation bar is because it is called upon within the constructor (and before it returns), hence it's considered a method of Client object calling another method of the same object, therefore the two activation boxes are stacked ontop of each other.

That's exactly an issue I grappled with, because the way I prefer to refactor is not very easy to track, as you mentioned.

When coding them out, I actually prefer to write code for the "highest level" classes first (e.g. Duke, TaskList), sort of defining the API, before getting the detailed smaller classes (like Storage, Task) to fulfil the API. This ensures you have full control over the structure of your program from the start. However, this runs into the exact problem you are describing.

The safer approach might be to work ground-up by creating the smaller classes first. You would need to have a clear plan of which methods / functionalities go into which classes, very clearly defining the I/O offered by each class. Then, begin with the smaller classes that don't depend on others, so you're adding new classes such as Storage while keeping your main long Duke file the same as before — throughout the process, your newly created classes are used minimally, if at all. Then once the smaller classes are done, you can refactor your main Duke class to incorporate their use. This way, there exists working code every step.

In my opinion, it becomes less crucial but still incredibly useful. I can think of three main benefits:

1. Experimentation in several different directions, in parallel, while keeping a functional main branch safe.
2. There are automated CI/CD tools that activate on accepted PRs, including testing and deployment, so it would be good to make use of these. Especially in a big project where a careless push might end up disastrous.
3. Reviewing your own PR through the powerful "diffing" visualiser on GitHub is useful for catching bugs and reasoning about why you made certain changes.

However, I personally think layers of PR over other PRs might be too confusing for amateurs like me. Imagine reasoning about PRs from your fork's branches to your fork's master vs PRs from your fork to the main repo... :(

Our special character enhancements will be controlled by a single REGEX variable that will filter out special characters. We plan to add support for `-` and `/` characters.

I consulted ChatGPT for ideas on how to structure our code.

Sometime around week 4 our codebase got fairly large and it got somewhat disorganized for me.

One particular suggestion that caught my eye was how we can organize our commands into multiple classes, where there is a `Command` interface and the different command classes implementing from that interface. However at that point I had already implemented Java Enum, push and tagged it already and hence decided to ditch that idea. Below shows the suggested structure:

@ZhiWei1010 you might want to take a look at your `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` file. The CI failure is likely due to not being able to pass the tests listed in that file. Personally I removed `Perform IO redirection test (*NIX)`, `Perform IO redirection test (MacOS)`, and `Perform IO redirection test (Windows)` checks. Since in our latest iteration for iP we would be using GUI and not the CLI, hence I don't think the IO redirection tests would be relevant for our case. Hope this fixes your issue 😄 .

@ZhiWei1010 just a pro tip 💡 , can always refer to others' iP to see how they organize their files, from what I remember it was mentioned that it was actually encouraged. I was initially contemplating whether or not to delete those files when I was at `A-CI` stage. However, after looking at a few iP's I noticed most of them just left these files there but instead modified their `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` file. You can randomly find a student's iP repository [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/ip/network/members).

There is a bug in 2 out of 15 of my groups commands where an exception is not thrown when a duplicate field is entered. This causes the feature to behave incorrectly, only considering the last field entered.

My group had already foreseen that duplicate fields in the command would cause issues and have already created a function to handle this. This function will detect duplicate fields in the commands and throw an error if there was a duplicate field.

However, for 2 of the commands, we had forgotten to call this function in our error handling. Thus the intended behaviour of throwing an error for duplicate fields was not displayed for these 2 commands. 

The fix for this bug, it is only a 1 line fix per command, to call the shared function that has already been created.

However, we wanted to check that we are allowed to do without violating the feature freeze.

<panel  header="**4. :fas-info-circle: FileWriter/PrintWriter isnt writing to my file**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/97" expanded>

Currently using intellij and java 11. For my task, I need to write the contents of my list everytime there is an update to my list. However, I am unable to write to the file using PrintWriter/FileWriter. belle.txt and Duke.txt are under the same directory. 

Excluding other parts of my code, it looks like this

```
public class Test ``{``
    private static ArrayList<Task> list = new ArrayList<>();
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        String data = "This is a text inside the file.";
        try ``{``
            FileWriter fw = new FileWriter("belle.txt");
            fw.write(data);
            fw.close();
            Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
            sc.close();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            e.getStackTrace();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
    
However, it does not write to my belle.txt. The curious thing is if i start a brand new blank project, and use this code with Test.java and belle.txt in the same directory, it will write to belle.txt. Thank you for the help!!

hi, im not too sure about 1 and 3 but for point 2, i believe if the method returns void, there is no need to indicate the return type.

For point 4, I believe when we compare class vs object diagrams, we exclude the methods and the multiplicities from the object diagrams. I think this section from the textbook could be helpful in distinguishing the two.

in the class diagram, there is no association between chair and table class. If they had left out attribute in chair, there needs to be a line between the 2 classes.

As the object diagram shows there is an associaiton, this class diagram in c is not compliant.

Hi! I refactored the date classes and all seemed well; I tested it out with testcases and ran the app myself too. However, when I made a pull request, I am not passing the checks. This is the error message along with a screenshot of my IDE which made me feel rather perplexed:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/91833948/2c679c17-2df9-4b0a-aa32-36d3c4b2aea8)

In particular, gradle mentions that a line which does not exists in my file (line number 197, even though my file on the right only has 137 lines) is throwing an error. On closer inspection, I think it is using a dated version as well, since I refactored the code to use a getDate() method instead of accessing `.value` directly. I then went to check the commits in the PR, and it is indeed showing my latest commits. I have also searched through the entire codebase for the term 'dob.date' to see if this line exists in my code and nothing shows up as well. Does anyone have an idea of how to fix this?

Hi prof! I have 3 questions pertaining to this:
1. In the following screenshot, is it ok to fix the behavior such that regardless of case, only one variation is allowed? For example, the nurse can key in any one of fallRisk, FallRisk, FALLRISK only (along with other tags if required), otherwise the system will throw an exception? In our UG, we broadly define tags as: "Optional tags to categorize the patient by health condition or other descriptors. Tags should be alphanumeric and can be used multiple times."

2. Are we allowed to fix our platform's behavior to accept common names (such as names with "d/o", "s/o")?
3.  Similarly, are we allowed to fix limitations from the date time class such as it allowing 30/02/2024 even though it is an invalid date?

Thank you for taking the time to go through the cases.

Also to clarify, we do have some issues with text wrapping as well. For example, if the names/ tags are too long (~100 characters for example), it will go past the boundary of the screen. Even when expanding the screen, it seems that the text will still not be fully shown.

Since viewers will not be able to "see the full text in any way", we are able to fix this right? I am slightly confused as later on, it is mentioned that this may qualify as a nice to have as well. Thank you!

I see, thank you! For point 2, from the perspective that our app is a healthcare platform for nurses in Singapore, being able to match the exact legal name is critical in our opinion.

I used ChatGPT to generate some of my Javadocs at the start. I used it because I was not certain what to include in the Javadocs and also to get used to the syntax. After some time, I stopped using ChatGPT to generate Javadocs, and started writing them myself.

I found it really time-saving to use ChatGPT for Javadocs, as it took me quite a long time when I wrote them myself. The Javadocs generated were mostly correct and accurate as well, as long as the correct context was provided. There were some errors here and there but those were easily fixed.

I believe it should be the second point. Leaving it as tomorrow would be very subjective, what if the user forgets when he keyed in the task, unless your parser would parse words like tomorrow or next week and convert them into respective dates.

If we have to implement a reminder function based on the task date in the future, then the second implementation would help more.

The lecture says that this is false because there is a missing arrow (shown in blue). Does the navigability change the way with how we interpret multiplicities?

In part 3 of week 5 Individual Project tasks, it is mentioned that after merging 1 of the PRs on github, the master branch of the local repo will fall behind that of the fork. However, after I merged 1 of the PRs on github, and then I used the git status command in the local master branch,  it still says the local master branch is up to date with origin master although the local master branch do not have the latest changes compared to the remote master branch. 
Why does it say that the local master is up to date with remote master if the local master do not have the latest changes? The local master branch only received the latest changes after I 'git pull origin master'.

From what I know, a variable is considered as a constant if it has the 'final' keyword associated with it and we should name constant variables with uppercases and underscores. However, I have a variable declared as private final ... STORAGE but it gives a checkstyle error stating that STORAGE shouldn't have more than 2 consecutive capital letters.  This error is removed only when i changed it to private static final ... STORAGE.  Is this intended?

May I know why `A` is a more suitable answer to this question as compared to  `D`?

Based on my understanding, it would be ideal for the `c` to have the activation bar for the constructor and for `s` to have to have a longer lifeline than `c`. However, since this is not an option in the question, I was thinking that having the activation bar for the constructor of `c` to be more important than having a longer lifeline for `s`. Is this not the case?

3 Questions about sort & search:

1. If I sort the contact list by note `/sort ; field : note` results in the address book sorted in reverse alphabetical order, but instead in the User Guide, I mentioned that the list will be sorted in alphabetical order, is it okay to fix this bug or should I update in the UG to specify that it is reversed?

2. `/sort ; field : name ; field : phone`, I accidentally checked wrong duplicate prefix, but changing only 1 constant would fix it, would it be okay to fix this bug, or include it as part of the UG mentioning that it only accepts the last field for duplicate fields?

3. If `search` function does not check for invalid inputs like `abc` for fields like `phone`, is it okay to fix this bug, include it as part of UG to only include valid inputs or is this considered a planned enhancement?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Is it okay to fix some commands not showing the full list after performing a search on the address book?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/787" expanded>

Issue: `Delete`, `Pin`, `Unpin`, `Undo` and `Redo` commands do not show the full list after operating on a filtered list (after `search`)

For example, I have 3 existing contacts in the address book, e.g. `Alice`, `Ben`, `Charlie`, and then I perform a `/search ; name : Alice` on the address book. This will display only `Alice` in the current UI. But let's say I perform `/pin ; name : Ben`, it pins this contact, but the UI still displays only `Alice` only without showing the remaining contacts, but internally the commands are just working properly. The main issue is forgetting to add this line of code `model.updateFilteredPersonList(true)`. Is it okay to fix this issue by adding this line of code? Technically it does not change any behaviour of the code since it is an issue of not updating the display of the contacts.

<panel  header="**3. :fas-info-circle: Question on whether fixing a search functionality bug using parsers without changing any input validation is okay**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/759" expanded>

For this bug, in order to fix this bug, is it okay if I can parse the search query (e.g. `/search ; salary : $50/hr`) without making any changes to the validation of the search input. Because the feature flaw was that I did not use validation for `search` command, so would fixing this search functionality bug in order to search by integer without making any changes to the validation, be okay?

From the user point of view, the current behaviour allows users to key in any String input without any validation to search for salary, and the search command works by matching the String query with existing String input. In this case, we identified this lack of input validation as our feature flaw. By right, our Salary field follows this format `$X/hr`, but the search command does not perform this validation, so users can key in anything from `$`, `$5`, `50` etc.

But the current functionality bug is that if the user searches for example, `$5`, the search command returns all contacts with salary field containing this string, which unfortunately includes `$50/hr`. This is clearly a bug as I used String search to perform the search.

The proposed new bahaviour to fix the bug would be to parse salary through a parser to trim the extra terms and search by matching the integer, but the main issue is that would it be alright if I use the parser without making any changes to validation (i.e. still allow invalid inputs), in order not to violate the feature freeze? Or would it be okay to add validation to reject invalid parsed inputs in this case?

Thanks prof! Yup, majority of cases substring search would not really be an issue, but the only main problem is if the user searches for `$5`, expecting to get all the salaries that is $5/hr, but also gets salaries with $50/hr as well. Will that then be considered as a functionality bug and something to be resolved? Without it becoming a feature flaw?

For no. 2, `/sort ; field : name ; field : phone` results in sorting by phone number only, so this command does not check for duplicate prefixes, in my code I have the function call `verifyNoDuplicatePrefixesFor(PREFIX_SORT_COLLECTION)` in my code, but the issue is that I accidentally put in the wrong constant `PREFIX_SORT_COLLECTION`, and replacing it with just `PREFIX_FIELD` would fix this bug. Would this be an okay fix, since I already have this function in my code, and it only requires me to change 1 constant to fix this error?

We ended up fixing the test cases by returning a Person object in our MeetingBuilder instead. Really appreciate all your help on this!!!

Yes, that is correct it should be E for the reason mentioned for 3.03
For 3.04 this represents a dependency, an implementation has a triangle with dashed ~~arrow~~ line!

I noticed that when I downloaded the pdf (following the steps instructed on the CS2103 website), there is an additional "AB-3" on the header, even though it's not on the website. I also couldn't find it on the HTML code. So is this intended and are we not able to remove this? I'm just concerned as the user guide will also be a submission for CS2101 and "AB-3" will not seem relevant to non-CS2103 people at first glance to our project.

Hi everyone, I hope to get some help for level8 which I have been working on for some time. 

I am hoping the chatbot can accept dates and times of various formats but I keep getting different results whenever I add or change something. Everything worked when Deadline and Event was accepting String but I changed it to accept LocalDateTime and it does not work now.
And I've been staring at my code for too long so I am quite lost...

the inputs I hope it can accept are:
(year will be defaulted to current year if not specified. time is defaulted to end of the day, 23:59 if not specified)
```
deadline return book /by 2/12/2022 6:30 PM

event project meeting /from 2 Dec 2022 2 PM /to 3 Dec 2022 4 PM
event project meeting /from Dec 2 2 PM /to Dec 3 4 PM

This is the part of my code I think is the issue - the part that parses the LocalDateTime
```
  private static final String[] PATTERNS = ``{``
    "d/M/yyyy H:mm", "d/M/yyyy h:mm a", "d/M/yyyy h:mma", "d/M/yyyy h a", "d/M/yyyy ha",

Thanks everyone for the help!

I did restructure the code as @kokerinks suggested - making it cleaner, and I think the issue @yisiox brought up was relevant too.

What else I did was: 
1. Make the parser flexible with spacing
2. Be able to assume same date as `/from` when it was not specified for `/to` for event 
3. Allow the parser to assume current year **and** end of day when both year and time were not specified for **only** deadline (my initial implementation only applied the defaults to when **either, not both,** was not specified)

What I wanted to achieve was flexibility of user input to make the task manager more user-friendly, but I did not expect there to be this many variations to be considered.

Copilot was a great time saver for generating javadocs, though sometimes it missed out some parts like @params but that was trivial at least for me.

Other than using VSCode to package my classes and implement checkstyle, I attempted to use CLI for most of my coding, and I found myself turning to ChatGPT first, and then Google (Stack Overflow) when I had errors. 

I found AI very convenient to use alongside coding, so long as I knew what I was doing and could spot mistakes. I felt that I saved a lot of time from trivial coding using ChatGPT which allowed me to implement stretch goals and optional implementations.

Bonus skill I learnt from using AI is prompt-engineering. With newer, more powerful AIs that can read and generate code better, it is a tool that I think we should all become familiarised with and know how to make the best use out of it.

If I'm not wrong, when logging into SourceTree with your GitHub account, a Personal Access Token (PAT) is required. This token is associated with configurable permissions, and it is possible that during its setup, the necessary permissions for configuring workflows were not enabled. Consequently, this omission may be hindering your ability to perform workflow setups through SourceTree.

hi, just to share my experience, i did the same thing as you, whereby i only made 1 very big commit with all of the changes. 
to avoid confusion, i made a detailed high level diagram of all of the classes in my refactored version before actually coding, so i wouldn't get lost during the coding itself. it helped to a certain extent, but i feel that when possible, doing it in pieces (eg 1 class at a time) is definitely more ideal especially when the project classes do not rely on each other too heavily yet.

When do we know to use the composition symbol? My intuition here would be:
1. Handout &lt;>------- Section  (&lt;> is the composition symbol)
As when the Handout is deleted, it would make sense logically for the Section to be deleted as well, something like the folder/subfolder example in the notes.
2. There is no composition between Handout and Brochure, as there is a cyclical link where Brochures must point to exactly one handout, and a Handout can be referenced by a any number of brochures.

Is my intuition correct? Or is there something I'm missing here.

I have a question regarding a bug fix we implemented. Previously, there was a bug that allowed users to set a deadline earlier than the current date, for example, setting a deadline to January 1st, 2000.

We've now introduced a fix that generates an error message saying, "Hey, your date cannot be before the current date!" when someone attempts to set such a deadline.

Would this error message be considered a feature enhancement? I understand that Prof Damith has mentioned that making new error messages are considered feature enhancement, but we can't think of a way to handle this error without having a 'silent error' bug.

Thanks Prof, just one last quick question, if it is in a whole-part relationship, can the dependency line from Section to Handout be removed? 
Section has a static method with a Handout Object, meaning that it would be depend on the Handout Class.
Does this composition relationship capture this dependency as well?

There's a few issues that could cause this.
1) You've downloaded the wrong JavaFX runtime (e.g. x64 SDK instead of AArch64 SDK)

Hi prof, TA, fellow students.

Currently we loading from addressbook.json and checked the following parameters by their respective isValid and isNull methods.
-name
-phone
-email
-address
-subject
-payment
is checked and if invalid, a blank addressbook.json will be loaded.

We added a new field to persons, an Id class and only checked if it's null.

Can we check the validity of the Id to be in line with the others ?

 We feel that this would make our app meet the current level of support for manually editing the file from AB-3.

Hi TA & Profs,

Our team have fixed some bugs that was indicated during PE before that in their local repo and have not merged them into our teams.

Some of this bug fix might be considered fixing of feature flaws.

I've checked and the commit time of this fixes is before 5 Apr 10am, 

could we merge these fixes in or would this violate the "feature-freeze" in v1.4

Thank you !

It can be split as 
Factory tempFactory = u.creator();
tempFactory.increase(1);

1. It's the unit class calling it since u is of type unit.

I'm reposting this since additional context was requested.

I tested the commands `sort price` and `sort salary` during the PE (both are "numerical" fields). I notice that `sort price` sorts the prices using string comparison while `sort salary` sorts the salaries in increasing numerical order. I proceeded to report `sort price` as a `type.FunctionalityBug` (without mentioning sorting by salary).

Now, the team rejected the bug and claimed that string comparison is intended, quoting the UG that sorting is done in lexicographical order (they mentioned this in the UG). However, this behaviour contradicts with a user story in the DG.

Now I'm in a disadvantaged position since I did not mention the inconsistency between sorting by price and salary during the PE.

My options right now:
Option A: Argue the bug as a `type.FeatureFlaw` (since it contradicts with the DG). (I did not mention the DG in the original bug report. Am I allowed to add this information in?)
Option B: Proceed to argue the inconsistent behaviour of sorting by salary and report that as a `type.FunctionalityBug`. (I did not mention the sorting by price in the original bug report. Am I allowed to add this information in?)
Option C: Continue arguing that sorting by price should be done in increasing numerical order and thus it should be a `type.FunctionalityBug`. (Is this reasonable?)

In particular, may I check what is the allowable extent of quoting additional information during the tester response phase?  

If all of my options do not work, I feel that there is a loophole in this PE so that teams can write ambiguous documentation and reject bugs testers have reported by suddenly claiming that the behaviour is intended.

Will appreicate any advice on this. Thanks!

I will be using variables below for simplicity.

I tested commands `A` and `B` during the PE and they have inconsistent behaviours with each other. According to my judgement, command `A` has the correct behavior while command `B` doesn't. I proceeded to report the incorrect output of command `B` under `type.FunctionalityBug` (without mentioning command `A` at all).

However, now that the dev team argued that command `B` has the correct behaviour (which implies command `A` doesn't). It is possible to argue that the behaviour is consistent with the user guide (with ambiguity), while it clearly contradicts with the user stories in the DG.

What should I do in the tester response phase?

Action 1: Forgo the bug since I did not mention command `A` in the bug report.
Action 2: Continue arguing that command `B` has an incorrect behaviour. (i.e. disagree with the rejection)
Action 3: Adopt the team's logic but state that command `B` has a severe feature flaw.
Action 4: Report an issue with documentation.

All of Actions 2, 3 and 4 seem weird to me (and I'm not sure whether they are allowed), but choosing Action 1 means that there is a loophole in the PE which allows teams to get away with serious bugs (rather easily).

May someone advise for this? Thanks!

Our team received a bug report which should be not in scope (with high confidence). However, we feel that the severity of the bug should be Low instead of Medium. Since not in scope bugs do not carry any penalty for the team, is it wiser to just keep the severity as it is? Or are there any reasons (incentives) for us to downgrade the bug?

Yes, Java packages must correspond to the directory structure. `package src.main.java.utilities;` must be placed under the directory `src/main/java/utilities`.

In your case, it's better to create a common folder (say, duke) and place all your subfolders inside that common folder. Then, you can declare packagaes like duke.tasks, duke.utilities, etc.

Dear Prof, TAs, and friends,

may I ask if I am allowed to edit my UI a little to wrap the text? I believe it is currently hindering normal usage, referencing the FAQ under the feature freeze section on the course website:
<img width="304" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/122247192/e0344158-aed3-400a-9f62-75eaf5cd3763">

Currently, if a name is too long and still valid, it will be cut off from the panel and **there is no other way to view it, even after changing the window size.**
<img width="153" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/122247192/d0167b4d-28b1-42ce-8ea2-0dd7b1f16c53">
The same thing is happening with the address field, entering a long but valid address will cause the address to be cut off.

Thus, may I ask if it is okay for me to just enable wrapping for these two fields specifically to enable the user to view them? Thank you in advance 😄

Hi Profs, TAs, and friends

For context, our group has a select feature that displays the profile of the selected contact in a separate panel. The panel will update if the details of the selected contact are edited. Additionally, we also have a command that adds a tag cumulatively to a contact (addTag).

However, when a tag is added using the aforementioned addTag command, the changes will not be reflected in the profile panel at the side. Additionally, when the contact is deleted or the list is cleared, the details in the profile panel will not be removed.

May I ask if this constitutes 'incorrect' behavior as stated in the FAQ section in the textbook, under Feature Freeze or should we put it under Planned Enhancement? 

Thank you in advance and have a great day ahead!

@damithc Dear Prof, thank you for the clarification. May I ask one more question? 

Currently, we already have the (auto-updating the panel when the data changes) feature. However, it is only 'hooked up' to the edit command. We missed out the (1) delete command, (2) clear command, (3) addTag command. 

Thus leading to an inconsistency between the UI and the state of data as stated in FAQ Question 10:
<img width="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/122247192/fa8f0f4b-574f-4f04-845c-275728ffb479">

Is it considered a violation of the coding standard to omit the `break` statement in the `default` case, given that it is unnecessary?
If no, do we still need to include the `//Fallthrough` comment in the `default` case, even though it is obvious that the execution will go to the end of the switch block?

I resolved the issue by incorporating a 'try-with-resources' statement for the 'BufferedReader' in my 'Storage' class. This ensures that the file read is consistently closed after all the operations. The updated code looks like this:
'''java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file))) ``{``
    try ``{``
        TaskType taskType = TaskType.valueOf(taskStrings[0]);
        // Omitted code
    ``}`` catch (IllegalArgumentException e) ``{``
        throw new InvalidTaskTypeException();
    ``}``
``}``
'''
My old code:
'''java
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(file));
try ``{``
    TaskType taskType = TaskType.valueOf(taskStrings[0]);
    // Omitted code
``}`` catch (IllegalArgumentException e) ``{``
    throw new InvalidTaskTypeException();
``}``
br.close();
''''

For me, I created a new `gui` package consisting of `Main`, `MainWindow` and `DialogBox` classes. `Main` class extends `Application` and instantiates the `Duke` class. The entry point is the `main` method in the `Launcher` class which will then launch the `Main` class. Additionally, I converted `Ui` class into `Response` class, thus eliminating input from the command line entirely.

Here is my file structure:
```
.
├── gui
│   ├── Main.java
│   ├── MainWindow.java
│   ├── DialogBox.java

Because padding refers to the space between the border of your container and the content inside it. Try adding the `-fx-spacing` attribute in your dialog container `VBox` so that the children added inside will be spaced from each other.

You can add the `showInitialGreeting()` method in the `MainWindow` class and then retrieve the controller inside the `start` method in the `Main` class.

Hi prof, may I ask if the text truncates when the text field is too long is considered a feature flaw, as these are extreme values and the user can resize the window to resolve these issue; we can update it in the UG as known issues and things the user need to be mindful of.

> I found that cd-ing into the test folder each time to run it is a pain, so I used a SCRIPT_DIR so that you can run it outside of the folder. Feel free to copy and use.

Instead of using `$SCRIPT_DIR` to store the script's directory and `cd` to it, you can just wrap the script with `pushd` and `popd`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Change the current directory to the directory of this script
pushd "$(dirname "$0")" >/dev/null

# create bin directory if it doesn't exist
# ... the rest of your script

# Change back to the original directory
popd > /dev/null
```

You don't have to add `$SCRIPT_DIR` to every path anymore. 2 additional lines are not excessively long 😛

Can you show your testing script and your code for loading and saving data? The location where you run your class is important since your program will look for the specified path in the current working directory.

Also, did you handle the case where "data/bit.txt" does not exist in the current working directory? You will need to create them (the directory AND the file) before trying to read from or write to the text file. Hope this helps.

You should add `myFile.getParentFile().mkdirs()` to create the parent directory before calling `createNewFile()` to create the file.

> Thank you for you responses @Jerome-j and @lokidoki102. However, in line with what prof mentioned about how the user might not have a "project root" when you send the project to them, since the relative file path (now ./data/duke.txt) lies in Duke.java and is not a user input, how then would I be able to get my runtest.bat to use ../src/main/java/data/duke.txt instead?

Well, I think you can modify the test script to copy ../src/main/java/data/duke.txt to something like ./data/duke.txt before running the class.

Hi, I went in your code and saw that in `gradle.build`, you have `mainClass.set("seedu.duke.Duke")` on line 9 and `mainClassName = 'Duke'` on line 42. You should keep them the same and change the class name to the proper class (in this case, it supposed to be `duke.Duke`).

2. [Details of bug 2](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F15-3/tp/issues/151): The dialog window title is showing `help` but the appropiate title is `Email template`, can this consider as incorrect text and not cosmetic?

3. [Details of bug 3](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F15-3/tp/issues/149): When the user clicks on import in the import dialog window without selecting file, the main app does not show any error message, while it does not cause the app to fail and technically just cause confusion / inconvenience to user as per Q1, would like to confirm that it still takes precedence under the "user action fails silently" and could be fixed to just show an error message.

Thanks for bringing forth the discussion, sharing my two cents:

1. It is good to firstly figure out the relationship between the classes (if you prefer visualisation, UML diagram would greatly help) and what are the classes supposed to do. Then, I would make a note on the chunk of existing codes according to where it would be refactored to and then shift it based on the modularity of the program, for e.g. if codes based on storage class is first refactored, then introduce storage only into the refactored duke bot. So, it would be always working line by line where new modules refactored are gradually put into the refactored duke bot.

2. I would prefer to push commit that is in a functional state whether up to a certain point or fully functional but not one that would fail upon running. Reason being that if I were to reverse back to an old commit due to certain issues, me and other developers working together on the same project would have to identify which are the working codes and commits.

You can use Messages class to format personToEdit when returning the string in generateSuccessMessage.

I noticed a discrepancy between the explanation provided in Question 3 of the Mock Exam (Model Answers) and the terminology used in our textbook. 

In the mock exam explanation, "coding standard" and "coding quality" are treated as distinct concepts. However, in the textbook, they seem to be used interchangeably. 

Here are the specific references:

1. In the mock exam explanation, "coding standard" and "coding quality" are discussed as separate entities.

It appears that the tags have been successfully updated on your [iP repository page](https://github.com/beefsausagee/ip/tags). If you're referring to tags added more recently, you might consider executing the command:

```
git push --tags

My team has developed pin/unpin feature to prioritize some important contact to stay at the top.

During out testing, we realised that, pin/unpin feature works perfectly fine on its own.

May i know whether is this workflow is wrong? 

In our workflow, our team thought that it will be better to have minimal number of people responsible for the main team repo merging to reduce wrong code pushing issue into main branch. Quite confused in this part.

To clarify, as mentioned in the [user guide](https://chin-herng.github.io/ip/#exiting-the-program), the command to exit the program is `exit` rather than the default `bye` as given in the project template. This is an attempt to customise the chatbot, but also I find that `exit` would be more intuitive for a CLI application because most CLI applications use `exit` for termination instead of `bye`.

@faaheem13 Thanks for the input! Can you elaborate on what does it mean by "the program doesn't go forward"? Did the program terminate, or did you not receive any reply from the chatbot upon entering your input (i.e. only one dialog box with your input)? Are you able to check the directory containing the jar file and see whether there exists a directory named "data" with the file "bob.txt"?

Additionally, I have edited the issue description to clarify about the command used to exit the program.

@faaheem13 Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, the issues could not be reproduced from my end. I tried entering a command in a wrong syntax followed by a valid one. I did receive an acknowledgement that the task has been added. I have attached a screenshot below for clarity.

I ran the jar file in a new folder containing only the jar file. The directory as well as the data file was automatically created as expected. I tested my program on Windows 11 as well. In this case, it might be helpful to give more detailed Windows specifications. I am using the Windows 11 Home Single Language edition with version 22H2.

Hi, I am tagged so I figured that I might as well pitch in, despite the fact that this seems to have been resolved. It might be helpful to contribute my process of figuring out the cause of the error. I came to the same conclusion as @seanfirefox did.

I cloned the fork, pulled the problematic branch and `checkout`ed the problematic commit `1a033d06` (according to the PR timeline, this is the commit right before the PR is mentioned in this issue). I tried to run all tests and indeed 99 out of 310 tests have failed.

In particular, the `execute_storageThrowsAdException_throwsCommandException` test failed. The IDE shows that an `ExceptionInInitializerError` has been thrown. I searched online for information relevant to this error and found this [resource](https://www.baeldung.com/java-exceptionininitializererror) helpful. It turns out that the `Caused by: ...` section of the error message shows exactly which line of the static initializer is causing the error.

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Date must be in dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm format.
Date & time must be after the current time.
Time of appointment must be on the hour.
	at seedu.address.commons.util.AppUtil.checkArgument(AppUtil.java:39)
	at seedu.address.model.meeting.Meeting.<init>(Meeting.java:48)
	at seedu.address.testutil.MeetingBuilder.build(MeetingBuilder.java:72)
	at seedu.address.testutil.PersonBuilder.withDefaultMeetingA(PersonBuilder.java:107)
	at seedu.address.testutil.TypicalPersons.<clinit>(TypicalPersons.java:60)
```

As per the resource given, `<clinit>` is the class initializer method. Line 60 in `TypicalPersons.java` seems to be part of a statement that is causing the issue.

```java
public static final Person JAMAL = new PersonBuilder().withName("Jamal").withPhone("88888888")
            .withEmail("jamal@example.com").withAddress("little india").withDefaultMeetingA().build();
```

Following the stack trace, `withDefaultMeetingA` calls `MeetingBuilder#build`, which calls the `Meeting` constructor, which calls `checkArgument`, which throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. Here is the `checkArgument` method:

```java
public static void checkArgument(Boolean condition, String errorMessage) ``{``
    if (!condition) ``{``
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(errorMessage);
    ``}``
``}``
```

Looking into the `Meeting` constructor, we know that `isValidDateTime(dateTime.format(formatter))` evaluated to false, where `dateTime` has the value of `LocalDateTime.parse("05-02-2024 13:00", formatter)` and `formatter` has the value of `DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm")`.

The `isValidDateTime(dateTime.format(formatter))` method essentially checks whether `"05-02-2024 13:00"` is before `LocalDateTime.now()`, and returns false if so. Now we see why `checkArgument` throws an `IllegalArgumentException`, ultimately causing the `ExceptionInInitializerError` and the test cases to fail.

> I am not even calling withDefaultMeetingA though, I am quite confused as i only added two small methods to Person.java and it is breaking everywhere.

We can figure this out by looking at where exactly did `ExceptionInInitializerError` occurs. The IDE shows that it occurred in the `assertCommandFailureForExceptionFromStorage` method, on line 170. This method is being called by`execute_storageThrowsAdException_throwsCommandException`, which is one of the tests that will be run when we run all tests. On line 170, the test makes use of `AMY` from the `TypicalPersons` class, so the class initializer method (the so-called `<clinit>`) of `TypicalPersons` is being executed, which will initialise all the static variables in the class, among which is the problematic `JAMAL`, which calls `withDefaultMeetingA`.

Hi, our group realised our tp's overall Java CI failed on the dashboard after we submitted our tp deliverables, and after investigating, we realise it is due to a failed Java CI action that we did not expect, since all the Java CI of our PRs passed.

Although the above shows a failed build, when we checked the PR #219, as shown in the "Checks" tab , it actually passed all the checks when it was merged, so we are unsure of how the build failed as well.

Our team completed our issues for milestone v1.1 before the deadline yesterday (Thursday 2359), but we realise the Java CI is failing on our progress dashboard.

While we suspect that this may be because we merged some PRs that failed the Java CI, we still merged because of this line in the workflow guideline from the course website: 
> An exception to this guideline is when the failure is confirmed to be due to something you can afford to ignore

Given that all of the PRs that failed were due to trivial errors that did not affect our code correctness and could be ignored (see following screenshot for example):

@bgopi23 I'd say you could still give it a try!! It really helps with efficiency :) 

From my experience of using GCP, what I tend to do is to first write the line(s) of code by myself to ensure that the implementation is in the style and format that I want it to be (of course, accepting trivial suggestions). 

Then, if there are other similar methods or chunks of code to write (which was quite common when designing classes that involved abstracted methods created for each command e.g. in Ui.java or Parser.java), I will then use the GCP suggestions to complete some similar lines of codes. With this approach, I get to practise writing the code itself, and I felt that I was still learning since the logic flow of the code was ultimately designed and decided by myself! 

Hope that your experience with GCP (if you ever try it out) will be a good one too XD

I found this part quite tricky too... this is my interpretation but let me know if I understood it wrongly! 

I understood 'components' as parts of the code that focuses on various responsibilities, and 'cohesion' as the degree to which the components belong together, directed towards performing a single task. If theres one task (in this case, to interact with user), as part of SoC principle, we would be letting one component (GUI class) handle it to prevent functional overlap rather than combining with another class (with an unrelated responsibility). 
<img width="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/103313573/dda26ef5-c19c-46ce-9220-8ce816f6b587">
From the explanation &hat;, we can see that by isolating the GUI class, we know the GUI class' sole responsibility IS in user interaction, thus all the code in GUI class are highly related to perform this same task, achieving high cohesion.

(I'm not sure how much I should divulge about my PE testing project, so I've kept their information anonymous)

During the PE, I made a bug about the UI of a specific command being clunky and difficult to use and proposed an alternative.

Specifically it is about the user needing to find a unique pair of indices of persons. The persons should be paired in the state of the program itself, so it didn't really make sense for me to have to provide both indices.

The team I did the PE for has a planned enhancement that they will change the program to include multiple overlapping pairing, which seems grounds for rejection. But they also mention groupings of multiple people being one part of a pair. This seems like it would need some other UI entirely and that the enhancement would rather obsolete the UI problem I'm having now rather than fix it.

So, if a planned enhancement obsoletes an issue right now instead of truly fixing it, is that fair for getting rejected?

This is not a bug per se, but that's the closest tag there is.

W8.5e has this highlighted part telling us to watch 4 minutes and 50 seconds in. I was thinking it'd be better if the youtube url was timestamped itself like so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDFI19lj4OM&t=290s

Of course, this has the possibility of disorienting users who expect to watch the whole video so a disclaimer might still be necessary.

My decision was to just allow one date and time format. Advantages are that it's unambiguous and easy to implement. My code throws an error if it's not in that one format.

There is also the alternative design idea of having a custom flexible time system similar to how [taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/dates/#synonyms-hahahugoshortcode-s0-hbhb) does it. It's less cumbersome and faster from a UX standpoint, but it's scope is probably way too big for a project like this.

Keeping backwards compatibility as a string won't really make sense if any filtering based on date is implemented later, but maybe they can be kept around for output purposes.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Is this a feature flaw?**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/743" expanded>

We received a bug report with type.FeatureFlaw in the PE.dry run. For the context. For the context, we have a separated list from the original contact list which will record appointments and each appointment has a time field. We have a `adelete` command that can be used to delete an appointment. The bug report is saying that it is inconvenient to delete expired appointment one-by-one and they suggest that it is better if the system automatically deletes expired reservation after 30-40 days. 

Our doubt is: is this considered a feature flaw and we will get penalty in the actual PE if someone reports this and we do not include this in planned enhancement of our DG?

If yes, then are we allowed to add this to the planned enhancement in the DG? As it is said that no new feature is allowed in the planned enhancement and we feel like this is a new feature.

For me I treated it as Parser is the class that decides what commands should be called as it is the one the processes all the info. I split the input string and then fed it into different commands based on the different scenarios, calling other classes like tasklist, todo/mark/unmark/etc and their methods where applicable like tl.mark(integer of desired task). I also called ui to display messages whenever needed. While I do think what the others have suggested is better in the sense of OOP, that's how I have implemented my Parser.

Hello, I tried to use [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master) to check the coding standard of my iP.

The xml file that it is checking against is [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml).

I used this config file as the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) stated the following:

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/64543157/3dfd64da-a281-4142-9e90-e493f4d1d038)


However, when I ran the checkstyle.jar file, I encountered many indentation errors which came from the following sections in the [google_checks.xml](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/blob/master/src/main/resources/google_checks.xml) file:
```xml
<module name="Indentation">
    <property name="basicOffset" value="2"/>
    <property name="braceAdjustment" value="2"/>
    <property name="caseIndent" value="2"/>
    <property name="throwsIndent" value="4"/>
    <property name="lineWrappingIndentation" value="4"/>

    <property name="ignorePattern" value="&hat;package.*|&hat;import.*|a href|href|http://|https://|ftp://"/>
</module>
```

I noticed that this was different from what was specified in the [Java coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/intermediate.html) page:

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/64543157/c9781614-9090-4302-b366-9d66b01f2f65)

May I know if the following modifications are sufficient in utilizing [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/tree/master) to check the formatting of my codes?
```xml
<module name="Indentation">
    <property name="basicOffset" value="4"/>

Hello everyone,

I'm experiencing a challenging issue while attempting to run a JavaFX application on my Apple Silicon Mac, and I could really use some guidance from the community. Below are the details of my development setup and the problem at hand:

Issue Description:
While attempting to launch my JavaFX application, I encounter a series of UnsatisfiedLinkError exceptions related to loading native libraries for JavaFX, indicating an architecture mismatch (x86_64 vs. arm64). Here's a snippet of the error message:

Loading library prism_es2 from resource failed: java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /Users/username/.openjfx/cache/17.0.7/libprism_es2.dylib: dlopen(/Users/username/.openjfx/cache/17.0.7/libprism_es2.dylib, 0x0001): tried: '/Users/username/.openjfx/cache/17.0.7/libprism_es2.dylib' (mach-o file, but is an incompatible architecture (have 'x86_64', need 'arm64'))

This issue prevents the JavaFX application from starting, with the system failing to find a suitable pipeline for the graphics rendering.

Attempted Solutions:
- I have ensured that my JavaFX SDK is intended for arm64 architecture.
- I've attempted to specify the --module-path and --add-modules options with the path to the arm64 JavaFX lib directory when executing my jar.

Additional Context:
Interestingly, my application works perfectly when I run it from my IDE using the launcher, but the issue arises only when I attempt to run the application from a shadow JAR file using `java -jar filename.jar`. This leads me to believe there might be something amiss with how the JAR file is being packaged or how it's handling the JavaFX dependencies, especially concerning native libraries and the architecture-specific configurations.

I'm reaching out to see if anyone else has encountered similar issues or has insights into potential solutions. Any advice on how to properly configure my environment to support JavaFX on an Apple Silicon Mac, especially regarding the packaging of a shadow JAR that correctly handles these dependencies, would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help!

1. When refactoring and adding new classes, I integrated them one at a time. It helped keep things working smoothly without causing too much disruption
2. In the depth-first refactoring approach with new dependencies, I think its usually better to commit changes once the code is stable rather than when it's temporarily not working

I encountered an unexpected disparity where my terminal was operating on Java 11, while IntelliJ IDEA's command line was configured with Java 21. Following the adjustment of my IntelliJ command line to Java 11, the issue has been successfully resolved. Thank you to all who contributed their insights and assistance.

Thanks for opening my thread :)
My Launcher.java file works fine on windows and mac, but crashes on Linux with the QuantumRenderer error.

It's especially odd as I've tested the Launcher.jar on windows and a macbook pro and it works on both, but it seems throw the exact same QuantumRenderer error on a normal macbook. Edit: The macbook didn't have the Zulu 11 with javaFX, its fixed now!

I suspect it has something to do with my JDK and/or gradle JVM settings, I'm currently using Amazon corretto 11.0.22, and I've verified the gradle JVM is the same as the Intellij JDK. I've pasted the build.gradle(sorry about the weird GFMD formatting)


edit: I've tried like 5 different JDKs including ones bundled with javaFX already, the same error still exists

Fixed! Genuinely not sure what I changed that made it work - I was testing on a macbook without the right JDK so I changed 50 different things and installed a new JDK 5 times.

Yep! Tested the old Jar and it still produces the same error. Its really really strange because I'm 95% sure it wasn't a jdk/jvm issue. 
My best guess at this stage is there may have been some problem with the JavaFX version - I was previously using 17.0.8, but changed it to 17.0.7.

Still idk tho, why would it work in every OS through both IDE and JAR except linux. all the other quantumrenderer bugs on this forum was problems with the terminal/running in ide/wrong jdk versions so it was really hard to debug.
oh well.

edit: forgot to mention i used Ubuntu on oracle VM virtualbox, which produced the exact same error message as the automated smoke test in the image above. 

edit 2: oh and forgot to add I switched to Azul zulu openjdk 11.  May have been some strange interaction with amazon corretto that caused the linux bug. idk.

Have tried installing javafx macOS as per the [github pages](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html).
However it did not work. Despite deleting everything in the JavaVirtualMachines and the relevant files, javafx still failed to run.

After a while I realised it was because the original java running on my mac was not from Oracle and not kept within Library/Users/Java/JavaVirtualMachines, hence following the youtube video did not really work.

I was able to resolve this issue by removing the OpenJDK following [this](https://admin-api.codejava.net/java-se/uninstall-jdk-on-macos). Where apart from removing the files given in the youtube video, I also ran 

```bash
sudo rm -rf Path/To/OpenJDK
```

After resetting the environment variable of JAVA_HOME to point towards the newly installed azul-11.jdk and restarting the IDE, gradle could finally run with javafx.

Hope this helps other mac users facing this issue!

 I was thinking if could also be possible to check if the output is within a certain set of values. (In this case, the list of strings you are getting the greetings from) ?

eg. psuedocode:

greetings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
if (output not in greetings) ``{``
   fail test
``}``

I think this could possibly be added to the .bat / .sh using grep. But I'm not too sure either :(

I have encountered <b>LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.Duke</b>.
                                <b>Process 'command 'C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-11.0.22/bin/java.exe'' finished with non-zero exit value 1</b>


This occurred after configuring Gradle. If I set the SDK to JDK 21, which is the same version that my PC has, the code runs.

Can I please know how to fix this?

> @PateShin it might help to explain what action caused this i.e., what change made it go from working to not-working? Also, which iP increment are you in now?

It happened after setting Gradle. However, I found that the JAR file is working, so for every change, including editing, I have to package as a JAR file to test, instead of running the code directly from the file using Shift+F10. As a result, I have completed A-JavaDoc, A-CodingStandard, and Level-9.

Just to add on, if Gradle is set, am I only allowed to run the code via a JAR file?

> Did you also use gradle in VSCode to run? If not could you share any more screenshots? i.e. your build.gradle file or more log output

I just opened the same directory in VSCode to see if the problem is related to the code or IDE.

@ZhiWei1010, Gradle.yml is attempting to locate the directory, but because you removed it, it will be unable to do so and an error will occur. So, consider to restore those folders and files related to text-ui-test (e.g runtest.sh and runtest.bash).

The issue, as I guess, is that runtest.bat and runtest.sh are unable to locate the **java files** because you may have moved the files from `../java/*.java` to `../java/[your package]/*.java`. Personally, I recommend to update the runtest.sh and runtest.bat files to include the correct directory. You may consider to edit which are directories in `javac` and `java` in `runtest.bat` and `runtest.sh`, to specify the classpath correctly. Furthermore, as @SimKianSeng mentioned, consider finding a student's IP repository to review.

A tester has reported that after executing the `mark` command to mark the attendance of a student in a particular group on a particular week when on one of the groups tab (e.g. "LAB10" tab), the program will switch back to the "Results" tab instead of remaining on the same tab. The expected behavior is to remain on the same tab but was not stated in the UG v1.3.  Is this considered a bug as it differs from normal expectation of the feature? 

Before marking attendance:

A tester has reported that when on the "LAB05" tab, if a student is in multiple groups (e.g. TUT04 and LAB05 as shown in the picture below), the attendance table shown should only be for that specific group, in this case "LAB05", instead of all groups that the student is in. Can this be considered a bug that can be fixed since the UI is showing "excess" data i.e. "incorrect" data?

I faced a similar issue before but I'm using windows so not sure if my solution will be helpful. The problem that I faced was I used the wrong jar file association (I was using jre instead of jdk). 

In terminal, I checked for the current jar file association using `ftype | find "jarfile"`. My jar file association was: `jarfile="C:\Program Files\Java\jre-1.8\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*`. 

Using the Registry Editor application, I clicked into the following path: `Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\jarfile\shell\open\command`. 
Then, I updated the jar file association to: `"C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.5\bin\javaw.exe" -jar "%1" %*`.  Note that your version of jdk and jre may differ slightly so do edit the paths accordingly.

@damithc Thanks for the clarification! Yes, the attendance table inside the person card remains the same regardless of which group tab the user is on, except for the "Results" tab which does not display the attendance table for brevity sake.

Using the example of person "Bernice Yu" in the screenshot in my original post, when I navigate to the "TUT04" tab, which is the other group that Bernice Yu is in, the same attendance table can be seen below.

However, are we allowed to save the textbook portion of the website as an html file and "access" the website that way?
i.e. on Microsoft Edge, Save Page As (Ctrl + S)  -&gt; "CS2103_T - Textbook.html"

It does not require internet access. The website version of the textbook is easier and more friendly to navigate, which is why I would prefer this if possible.

I didnt seem to be able to successfully branch-level-7, so now imtrying to figure out how to branch-level-8 and let it meet the iP tracker thing, because im quite confused. I've been using github desktop for this btw.

I would appreciate some indepth instructions please and thank you :')

```
Do Level 7 in a branch named branch-Level-7. Here are the steps:

- [X] Start a branch branch-Level-7. 
- [X] Implement Level 7 while committing to that branch at appropriate points,
- [ not sure if i did this right. is the master branch in this instance the upstream master or my local master? ] Merge the branch back to the master branch (remember to create a merge commit i.e., no fast-forward).
- [ ] Git tag the merge commit in the master branch as usual (i.e., add the tag Level-7).
- [ not sure how to do this/ what it means] Push the master branch, push the branch-Level-7, and push the tag, to your fork.

 ! Advanced git users: do not delete the branch after merging.
 ! Only merged branches are detected by the script. After merging a branch b1 to the master branch, you need to push both the master and the b1 branches to the fork. Pushing the master branch does not automatically take the b1 branch along with it just because it is already merged to the master branch.

The following is a modified MSS presented by the team I'm reviewing: 

Use Case: UC01 - Adding a contact

MSS
1. User enters command to add a contact
2. AB adds the contact to the contact list
3. AB shows a success message along with the added contact's details
Use case ends

Extension
* 2a. A field of the new contact to be added already exists 
   * 2a1. AB shows an error message
   Use case resumes at step 1.

According to the course textbook, MSS only includes the externally visible behavior.
However, step 2 of the MSS presented by the team stated the internal details (process of AB adding contact into the list) and further extend from step 2. 

I surmised that Extension 2a should belong to step 1 instead, as step 1 stated the externally visible behavior. 
> Eg. 
> 1a. Command entered contains duplicated field as a contact in the contact list

The team rebutted that they have discussed with Prof and got the approval to present the MSS as above. Please do advise! 😟

Following up on your response, do correct me if I interpret it wrongly. Wouldn't step 2 be the 'process' of adding the contact to the contact list (internal). Then, step 3 will be the actual display of the display list (externally visible).

Reason for changing:
1. The previous version is kind of unclear for the instruction and it only provide an example command format which is adding a policy. It also didnt state out properly what it stance for. In the UG, it have mentioned clearly already
2. Adding misinformation for other action such as edit and delete to make it clear to the user, and also differentiate to 3 section to make it easier to see.

If your branch-Level-7 and branch-Level-8 were pushed to remote(github) previously and there is no new changes in them then I do not think there is a need to include them.
If I am not wrong, when you push, it means that you want your local changes/commits to be updated on the remote.

The application is just showing outdated error messages that doesn't include some command arguments specified in the UG. The thing is the application supports all these arguments fully as specified in the UG but I just forgot to update the messages shown to the user.

I understand that it's better to update the UG but I feel like I'm removing fully working features I actually spent time working on in the application just because I forgot to specify in the application message feedback.

It seems like your local branch is not pointing to a branch but to a specific commit, so the current state is not suitable for pushing the changes directly. 

As such, try create a new branch and make some changes to your code. Then, add the changed files and commit your changes. You should be able to solve the issue after you push the new branch and switch back to master, and merge them into master branch.

Our team application has a bug where a command called with a large number "1000000.05" results in a wrong number of "1000000.06" being returned due to the precision of using a float. Will setting the limit of the size of the number for the command be considered as a feature change? Otherwise, will using integer for the whole number part of the number and another integer for the decimal part of the number be alright?

1. Not too sure whether this will fix your issue, but one way you can clean up the patterns array is the split it into two different arrays - one array to store date formats and another array to store time formats. You can then use a nested for-loop and concatenate every single pairing of date and time formats while checking:

```
        String[] possibleDates = ``{``
                "d/M/yyyy",
                "d-M-yyyy",
                "d/M/yy",
                "d-M-yy",
                "dMMyyyy",
                "dMMyy",

                "dd/MM/yyyy",
                "dd-MM-yyyy",
                "yyyy-MM-dd",

                "dd/MM/yy",
                "dd-MM-yy",
                "ddMMyyyy",
                "ddMMyy",``}``;

        String[] possibleTimes = ``{``"HHmm", "HH:mm", "HH", "h:mma",``}``;

        for (String datePattern : possibleDates) ``{``
            for (String timePattern : possibleTimes) ``{``
                //check that time pattern comes before date pattern
                try ``{``
                    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(timePattern + " " + datePattern);
                    return LocalDateTime.parse(input, formatter);
                ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
                    //do nothing
                ``}``
                //check that time pattern comes after date pattern
                try ``{``
                    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(datePattern + " " + timePattern);
                    return LocalDateTime.parse(input, formatter);
                ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
                    //do nothing
                ``}``
            ``}``
        ``}``
```

The formats are clearer this way, and if it is an issue of an invalid datetime format hopefully you can catch it this way.

2. If the above doesn't fix it, maybe you can send the error which you are getting? Will give a better sensing of what is going wrong

Personally I used Github Copilot during development of the iP. Here are some of my insights:

GitHub Copilot (GCP)
+ usually accurate for trivial code like printing to console and simple iterations through lists

+ fairly accurate production of javadoc (may need to amend 5-10% of the time)

- tends to produce incorrect code for more complex tasks like sorting on a custom comparator, or loops with more complex iterations

- can easily mislead the programmer to work in the wrong direction (may produce a set of code which looks like it may work at first, but actually costs the programmer to spend 5-10 mins trying to debug it before realising it cannot work)

TLDR: If used efficiently, you can potentially cut your production time by up to 40 or 50%. If used haphazardly, you could end up wasting more time instead debugging code which was poorly-written by GCP. Personally found GCP helping more than it hurt, but need to be conscious of which suggestions you are accepting.

Hi all, thank you for visiting my thread.

Im having the issue that when I run my iP code through gradle, Im getting the error:

Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @40040d57'
java.lang.RuntimeException: Error initializing QuantumRenderer: no suitable pipeline found

I am aware that this issue has been posted to the forums before, however, mine is slightly different because if I just run my JAR file or click run at the top right for my Launcher, they both work perfectly fine. I am not sure if running through gradle is an iP requirement?

Thanks for any help!

Hi there, the error you're encountering seems to be related to a duplicate entry in the JAR file's metadata... I suspect it might be an issue with your build.gradle file. Double check that your Gradle version and dependencies are correct. After that, you can try the command "./gradlew clean build" to run the build again. Let me know if this helped. If the issue persists, could u please also attach ur build.gradle file?

Another possible solution would be to write a custom exceptions class that extends ur main DukeExceptions. Then when u are unsure which exception to catch, you can just catch the main DukeException. This is not perfect because it is not specific, but it is far better than just the Pokemon catch with "catch (Exception e)". Hope this helps c:

Due to forgetting to add one of the command prefixes to the ArgumentTokenizer one of our commands does not accept an optional argument as of v1.3. However, the UG was also not updated at the time of v1.3.

Our project has a schedule command, that when run, is supposed to display a schedule of events and reminders. Unfortunately, we did not do enough testing before v1.3, and as of now the schedule command only displays a blank window when run.

Hi all, I'm sure this is not the expected behaviour but everytime I load gradle project (see 3rd pic), the run icon goes from green to grey (in other words, my file goes from being able to run to "the file in the editor is not runnable"). There is no quick fix other than me having to manually remove the modules and adding them back and reconfiguring the source folders. I am pretty sure this is not the expected behaviour, am I doing something wrong?
Would love to hear some suggestions on how to fix this ASAP. Thanks in advance.

Hi everyone and prof @damithc, I have added a new branch "branch-Issue" with my latest code in it. https://github.com/Zack-Tay/ip/tree/branch-Issue

Not sure what went wrong as well, after merging the add-gardle-support, I kept getting episodes of "the file in the editor is not runnable". The problem is persistent because 
"the run icon goes from green to grey (in other words, my file goes from being able to run to "the file in the editor is not runnable"). There is no quick fix other than me having to manually remove the modules and adding them back and reconfiguring the source folders. "

and after I click "load gardle scripts" (3rd pic) or do any updates to the build gradle file, the problem that i have quoted will occur again.

Thanks in advance for anyone helping!

To add on to the above comment, if you want to run the program just to check if its working, you should run Launcher.java and not Duke.java.

The question might be general. For example we need to put parts of codes into different packages. And then we need to modify the visibility of some functions which were supposed to be private helper functions. I know this side effect can be minimized through refactoring, but we still have such risks.

I assume you are using `Assert` in your test methods. My trick is to only choose one between the actual and expected output to consider. If you have confidence that your implementation is correct, it is more likely that the newly added test classes have bugs. They are harder to detect than the main codes. IDE can tell the corresponding output by the test codes.

> @JerryWang0000 Can you elaborate on this example a bit more? A class cannot access a private method of another class, irrespective of which package it is in. Perhaps you are referring to the [_extract class_ refactoring](https://refactoring.guru/extract-class) instead?

Yes, exactly. My bad. I was thinking that, a class can have getter to retrieve one of its attributes. If we put it in another package, that means we might have to change getter to be "public", which could have been only seen within the package. Will that be considered undesired?

Hi, I would like to ask about representative use cases required for the DG for v1.1 on behalf of my team @AY2324S2-CS2103-F15-1.

> Use cases: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)

> Important use cases missing (a use case is important if it involves a user interaction that is worthy of documenting e.g., it has multiple extensions -- this is not the same as the feature being important)

1. To clarify, suppose the add contact feature does not have multiple extensions. Although it is a core feature, it is alright to exclude it from the use case in our DG?

2. What is considered having multiple extensions? For instance, `delete` in the current DG has 2 extensions. Do we use that as the baseline where all user cases that have more than or equal to 2 extensions should be included?

3. What if we have multiple use cases that have very similar paths. For instance, if many of our index based commands are similar to `delete`, will the `delete` use case alone be sufficient? Or suppose we have a more complex index based command such as `edit` which also includes extensions with invalid fields (where values do not comply for instance). Can we include the `edit` command only? Or are we recommended to still include both `delete` and `edit`?

@damithc Hi Prof, I would like to follow up on this question as we are still unsure of the best way to fix the bug for v1.4

1. Should we go with the minimum code change, or are we allowed to implement longer code changes but retains our previous behavior as much as possible. To fix the bug, we can simply set the height of the window to be the max screen height and implement a scroll pane to ensure all commands are viewable. However, this would change the behavior for some other machines that did not face this issue as now their help window will fit the height of their screen. Is it acceptable to add more code to only change the size if it exceeds the max screen height?

2. Is it right to say that making our help window resizable is violating the feature freeze if our previous help window did not initially have this feature? Given that it is difficult to test whether our planned fix would work, we were discussing if we should allow the window to be resizable in the case where there is still issues with reading the text and the users can at the very least resize the window to fit their screen.

Thanks!

I feel that it is okay to not declare any constant for it here as the method name is well explained. However, I think there is no harm in declaring a constant for better readability, and convenience. The textbook did mention that magic literals should be avoided in general as well

There are two types of binding in java, static binding (early binding ) and dynamic binding (late binding). Overriding methods are resolved using dynamic while overloaded methods are resolved using static binding. The main difference between the two is the stage they take place in, static binding takes place during compile time while dynamic binding takes place during runtime. When you overload a method, the compiler is able to tell which method you're trying to call based on the method signature (name + parameter list). When you use method overriding, the compiler doesn't know which method you're trying to call since the method signature is the same in both subclass and superclass. Take this for example

```
    public static class A ``{``
        void print()
        ``{``
            // Line 1
        ``}``
    ``}``
    public static class B extends A ``{``
        @Override void print()
        ``{``
          // Line 2
        ``}``
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args)
    ``{``
        A a = new A();
        A b = new B();
        a.print()
        b.print()
   ``}``
```
During compile time objects aren't initialized yet, so when we do b.print() we have no idea which function to call, the one in the subclass or the one in the superclass. It is only after dynamic binding during runtime that we actually know which function to call. Hope this helps

I was able to replicate the issue by cloning from your fork. In your intellij go to Project Structure and make sure the only two modules are ip.main and ip.test. When i pulled from your fork, src was a module as well so the IDE was not able to find the proper class files

According to the website,

> Association labels describe the meaning of the association. The arrow head indicates the direction in which the label is to be read.

In the example, the `SquareGame` should be played on a `Board`, yet the arrow in the association diagram is pointing the other way round, implying that a `Board` is played on a `SquareGame`. May I know if this was a typo or is there a mistake in my understanding of the example?

For the above question, could a possible answer be 2 where one is s = null and s.length() = 1 to obtain the smallest number of test cases ? Since the number of possible loop is only one loop and this test case will cover 100% of the loop coverage for the above method.

My team have some doubts regarding CS2103T v1.4 feature freeze and would like to clarify them.  

My team would like to make the following fixes to our app but are unsure if they would violate the feature freeze constraint. The changes planned are as follows: 
1. Update the email template generation feature to throw an error when a non-existing group is provided. 
2. Update the email template generation feature to throw an error when an existing group has no students. 
3. Update the email template generation feature to throw an error and check whether the existing group provided has been assigned their specific telegram link. 

One of my team's application features is to generate an email template for the user. However, in the User Guide we have specified that it is required for the parameter to be a "valid existing group" but our app was unable to catch this constraint for v1.3. Therefore, we were wondering if change (1) is a valid bug fix. However, we are unsure for changes (2) and (3).

In our User Guide, we have specified that it is required for the parameter to be a "valid existing group".

However, we are unsure if our assumption above are correct. Thank You!

I changed the person class property and removed address and telephone number and added student id and telegram handle as their property. This caused me to change the class names in the main and test units.

After fixing the code I managed to get the main running, which means that there isnt any compilation error for main.

However, when I build with Gradle, the test units are failing with a message that I do not understand.

I have changed all the class names and ensured that they are correct in the test units, i.e. there wasn't any compilation error.

I've checked online and it seems that the issue is with the class path but the two properties I added are in the same file as person where address and phone was before. 

Has anyone faced this issue? Any help appreciated.

Hi, I got a similar error and my mistake was that my mainclass was not set properly. My Launcher is in java/duke/ui directory and had to specify the build.gradle file as such:

```
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.ui.Launcher")
``}``

shadowJar ``{``
    archiveBaseName = "duke"
    archiveClassifier = null
    dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")
    mainClassName = "duke.ui.Launcher"
``}``
```

Perhaps double check your file structure?

Our `Find` command allows the search for the gender attribute which has 3 possible vales `M`, `F` and `Prefer not to say`. The intended way to filter for these genders would be `find g/m`, `find g/f` and `find g/` respectively. We made a design consideration earlier to shorten `Prefer not to say` with an empty input instead. However, the command currently incorrectly parses this and throws an error to the user saying `Gender must be M, F or exclude argument in the command for 'Prefer not to say'` when entered `find g/`. Hence, there is no way for the user to find for the gender `Prefer not to say`. Would this be fixable or is it an enhancement?

That whitespace is set by the "spacing" property of the HBox, which you can find in the PersonListCard.fxml file.
It looks like the default spacing is set to 5. Possibly lowering it to 2.5 would suit your preferences.

> @raysonchia What did the v1.3 UG say about this feature? Was the intended behavior described there?

The UG mentions the behaviour of the empty input `g/` in other commands e.g. `add`, `edit`. The current error message for `find g/` also mentions this behaviour.

Hi! I would like to check on my understanding of association between objects in an object diagram. My understanding is that in this bidirectional navigability between children and fiction means to say that:

children object has a reference to fiction (and vice versa) e.g.
```
Category cat = fiction;
```

But between student and loan (and book), there is no navigability(?) between the objects, unless we chose to omit such details as it may not be necessary?

Hi Everyone, 

I would like to clarify a bug report detailing the presence of duplicate persons. Currently, our implementations allows duplicate people to slip through, either via addition or editing of current persons. This causes some issues with other implemented commands such as pairing between persons. I would like to clarify if we were to rectify this issue, would this be allowable under v1.4? (would it violate feature freeze?)

It was not explicitly mentioned in our UG to disallow duplicate persons, and so as per [Q3](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#:~:text=FAQs%20on%20what%20is%20allowed%20during%20the%20feature%20freeze%3A) of the FAQ, would it be reasonable 'correct' to expect duplicate persons to be disallowed? Hence, would it be allowable to treat this as a bug fix, and implement a simple equality check and throw a general error?

Thanks in advance!

@damithc 
For context: https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/132
Due to the duplicate persons in the list, when pairing, the wrong person (at a earlier index than specified) in the list gets paired up, which is incorrect behaviour.

Edit: 
There is also another associated issue: (https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/issues/178)
Which causes an error to be thrown when pairing in the presence of duplicated persons

@damithc Just to clarify, I am asking about the User Guide and Developer Guide in the **Github** release. From what I can see, there isn't any specific naming convention for the files on the Github release, only for the Canvas submission. Thus, will it be possible to rename our UG and DG.

I think the issue could be in your load file program, or something that caused it to malfunction.
If you had just updated your class/change names etc, you can consider to delete the previous file that was created and for it to create a whole new one on its own again. That should fix it for your next iterations with the updated file. (Was what i do when i had some loading issues and discovered it was due to change of class/name)

are the 2 branches that you talk about `branch-level-7` and `remotes/origin/branch-level-7`? If it is, `branch-level-7` points to the local branch and `remotes/origin/branch-level-7` points to the branch that is pushed to github.

I've cloned your project, and it seems to work fine (no errors thrown on IntelliJ) when I repeatedly run and exit the program. If you have another terminal, maybe try running the same code on that terminal to test if that error is still thrown?

Hi Profs and TAs, should the following issue be considered a feature flaw as indicated by the tester?

This can be considered unusable for typical users as certain user's names are considered invalid when they contain special characters. Thus it is considered a functionality bug if we are fixing to allow for those names.

Or it can also be considered as a documentation bug since the UG can be more specific in the fact that names does not support symbols and other special characters.

@damithc I see! So the user guide could include something along the lines of

And then afterwards we should adjust the error message to reflect the user guide?

> Suppose you created some commits in week 8 but did not create a PR (because the feature is not complete yet). And in week 9, you added some more commits, and created a PR, which was merged. At that point, the grading scripts will see your commits in the team repo, and will recognize that you committed in week 8 as well as week 9, turning both weeks to green. But until the PR is merged, week 8 will stay red (which is fine).

Hello, we noticed that due to some autoformatting issue, the final jar file has been renamed to `CS2103T-D-XX-Y.PROJECT_NAME.jar` instead of `[CS2103T-DXX-Y][PRODUCT_NAME].jar`. We have also noticed that this has happened to some other groups.

While the file is downloadable and runs, we have included instructions for running the file in our release notes as follows:

```
java -jar [CS2103T-DXX-Y][PRODUCT_NAME].jar
```

In our UG and DG (and the product website). we have also indicated that the jar file is named as `[CS2103T-DXX-Y][PRODUCT_NAME].jar`.

I am updating my project's Developer Guide with implementations details for a new GUI panel that has been added. The implementation is similar to the way `PersonListPanel` is implemented in AB3 - react to changes based on an `ObservableList&lt;E>` inside `Model` class.

However, I am unsure of how to represent the changes to the GUI components (such as `PersonListPanel`) in a sequence diagram, since there is no single command that triggers the GUI to re-render.

A case I have considered is to use a dummy command that can trigger such a behaviour. For example, to trigger a change in `PersonListPanel`, I may call a `find` command that modifies the `filteredPersonList` inside `Model`. In this case, I would have to draw out all the steps (parsing, execution, etc.) and the diagram may not be directly related to GUI anymore.

May I know if there is some convention in drawing sequence diagrams to showcase this behaviour where a "listener" reacts to a change in some other attribute? Or are there other diagrammatic tools that are more suitable for this case?

**[Q5] Can we tweak validity checks for a user input, or error/exception handling?**

**A:** Can be allowed only if the current behavior causes the software to misbehave (i.e., crash, **give incorrect results**, store inconsistent data, or make it **unusable for typical users**).


Hi Prof, our application has a few commands that accept `Points` as a parameter.
e.g. `addpts n/Alex p/1000`, `addmempts n/James mp/50000`, `additem i/Chocolate p/7000`

However, in v1.3 we did not not put a limit on the number of points. Now, if we add a large but reasonable number of points there is an integer overflow problem and the value becomes negative. Since we are using a `Points` variable, it is very likely that a typical user may input these large values as the `Points` only increases for the person's whole lifetime. Moreover, since all our commands are related, this overflow can result in other functions failing as well.

Hence, we believe it is giving **incorrect results** when we use commands like `addpts` as the value becomes negative after 2,147,483,647.

As such, is this considered a bug and can we restrict the max number of points someone can have for the usability of the app for a typical user?

Okay so only if the method is specifically defined in the class (overridden or implemented) do I need to write it under that class in my class diagram. 

e.g. If a class implements an interface which has method1() but does not override this method then method1() wll only be under the interface class.

As Prof. has mentioned, exception handling is highly subjective and it is up you (or your team) to decide where to draw the line(s).

For me personally I consider `File Corrupted` and `File Not Found`, exceptions that should be handled in the `Storage` class. It relates to the storage data retrieval and as such, should be handled within and not by the external class utilizing it. This keeps a level of abstraction as external classes do not have to bother handling such trivial cases. Exceptions should be thrown (out of the class) only if the current class is unable to handle the error.

I agree with you in your example with the `DukeException`; if an appropriate exception is already available we should be using it instead of creating custom exceptions. I disagree with @JerryO3 's use (but it's not wrong to do so), as we can easily differentiate where the exception is thrown by simply following the stack-trace. Custom exception classes add a layer of complexity and if not named properly will cause confusion and decrease readability (like your example `DukeException`; what kind of error is it actually? I would not know without looking at code)

My impression is also that the two are very similar and can sometimes be used interchangeably.


One small difference I can think of is with regards to the type of project you have; **waterfall or agile**:

* In waterfall, you are developing with a clear end in mind. The definition of late and one time is: 

> Late and one-time: wait till all components are completed and integrate all finished components near the end of the project.

which is well representative of waterfall. Thus, `Late and One time / Early and Frequent` would be more applicable.

* In agile, you are iteratively developing, with small goals along the way.  The definition of big bang is:

> Big-bang integration: integrate all components at the same time.

which has no mention of waiting for an `end of project`. We can simply wait for all major components and start integrating only at the end of each sprint. Thus, `Big-bang / Incremental` would be more applicable.

Your `build.gradle` should be correct, its same as mine one. I was able to get the jar file by using `./gradlew clean shadowJar` in the terminal, and after that use the jar file generated in the `build/libs/duke.jar`. Another jar file generated in this directory is not runnable for me as well.

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Regarding code reuse from already existing AB3 code**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/783" expanded>



In the code reuse guidelines (found at [https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/admin.htmlLinks to an external site.](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/admin.html)), it states that if we reuse existing code from AB3 for our individual contributions to the tP, it should not appear under our own names unless we modify it significantly. 

In my `view` command implementation I largely followed the way the `delete` command was implemented in AB3 due to extreme similarities in how my command functioned (both commands use the index provided to grab the relevant person object and perform an action with it). As such, the structure and format for my `view` command, command parser and tests are rather similar to the existing AB3 code. But for the actual implementation of the command, action performed with the person object and output generated by the command, it is completely different. 

In the comment at the top of the java files for the `view` command implementation, I did mention how the code for the `view` command heavily borrows from the `delete` command due to its similarities as a form of reuse attribution. 

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/80389070/3e1ebd86-c5ed-4dec-a3ee-863c3889bf78)

So I want to check:
1. Is that significant enough change to warrant having the code be attributed to myself without causing any plagiarism issues? 
2. Is the reuse attribution sufficient for my case?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Clarifying possible action to take for bug reported as FeatureFlaw due to not enough detail**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/issues/735" expanded>



A PED tester reported a FeatureFlaw bug where the error message displayed when trying to add a tag with white space did not provide enough detail. But the error message already clearly states the required format, just not in an super obvious way.

When trying to add a tag to a contact with a white space in the tag name, the program will display an error message saying "Tag names should be alphanumeric" and block the command. 

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/80389070/a51760af-9ec1-47fc-9484-d0ed3587040f)

The tester points out that the error message is not specific enough as it does not match the User Guide detail that Tags should not have spaces (error message does not explicitly mention anything about 'spaces' like in User guide). 

![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S2/forum/assets/80389070/f6973229-39a8-48e5-9ff7-7c0010f2abf5)

But the term 'alphanumeric' used in the error message already implies that no spaces are allowed, as alphanumeric characters are limited to [a-zA-Z0-9] and do not contain space. We feel that using the term 'alphanumeric' already provides enough detail and it may just be that it did not occur to the tester that 'alphanumeric' does not contain spaces.

Is this considered a valid bug report which we need to resolve in the 'Planned Enhancements' section in the Developer Guide by mentioning we will update the error message to be more specific? Or can we just update the User Guide to use the same language as the error message to avoid confusion to resolve this?

This means that your jar file was compiled with a newer version of Java. Check the SDK that you are using in your IDE, if your IDE is IntelliJ, go to Files > Project Structure. Make sure the SDK is Java 11. If not, download it then re-run shadowJar from gradle. Hope it works!

> Thanks prof! However my java version is 17.. But all the steps about settings in IntelliJ are correct. I re-uploaded the compiled file.

hi, your terminal and IDE can be using different java versions. IDE is an integrated environment and is separate from your terminal, when you do `java -version` it checks your own environment variables which is **separate** from IntelliJ's configuration. So, while you may have ensured that IntelliJ and Gradle is using java 11, if your terminal is detecting java 17, it will not be able to run files compiled using java 11

> @bgopi23 Hmm do you have any idea why it failed... it works fine on my side so I have no clue why the linkage error or your failed run happens :(

when you say "works fine", did you use your terminal to run or you run Launcher.java directly on intelliJ? The latter works because as mentioned earlier, it is an integrated environment. 
If you can run it on your terminal, but other users could not run in on theirs, then it is very likely that you did shadowJar with a different java version

here's a few things to check:
1) run `java -version` in **your terminal**, make sure its java 11
2) check intelliJ's SDK again just to be sure it is also java 11
3) check your fxml files again just in case
4) go to Files > Settings, look for Gradle and check "Gradle JVM", make sure it uses java 11 which should match the project's SDK

hope this helps!

`nextLine()` throws a `NoSuchElementException` if no line was found. This means that `nextLine()` tries to read the next line from the `input.txt` file, but doesn't find a line.

To fix this, you can add the your command to exit, `bye`, as the last line of your `input.txt` file, so that `nextLine()` isn't called when there is no next line in your `input.txt`.

I think both approaches are valid, and the better approach would depend on what kind of product and target user you have in mind, as there are tradeoffs between each approach.

For example, if your target user is someone that prefers typing text fast over checking their calendar and inputting a date in the correct format, the first approach may be better, as it allows the user to quickly add tasks.

On the other hand, if your target user prefers the control and functionality over having actual dates, then the second approach may be better.

Hi, could I confirm if I am allowed to fix this bug by allowing inputs such as "08"?
While the error message is not matching the input (bug), the user can workaround by simply typing "8", and adding leading zeroes is not a common input also.

In the case of getters, in my experience they are usually just public methods written to access a field within a class while keeping the field itself private. So personally I don't think there's a tradeoff between visibility and modularization specifically for them. While there are some usecases for private getters I think their main utility is about letting the fields be accessed by other classes while hiding the fields.

As for other helper methods do you have a specific example in mind?

Hey Ruiheng! This is just my own input, but I too had some initial apprehension when deciding on whether to adapt my JavaFX code to FXML (considering I had just done it the classic JavaFX way...). However, what I found very useful was that FXML uses .fxml files which can be read in SceneBuilder and handled like a CSS equivalent for Java! I highly recommend finding the time to attempt it so that you have a more accurate idea of which one you might prefer!

**Context**: I finished my `A-CodeQuality` improvements last week. However, I tagged the wrong commit with the `A-CodeQuality` tag and pushed this change to the remote fork repo.

In an attempt to rectify this error, I thought a natural thing to do would be to delete the current tag and create a new one on the correct commit. I googled and came across a post that suggested that I can delete a tag by using the following command:
`git push --delete origin tagname`

So I used this command, and I think I ended up making it worse because the tag is deleted from the remote repo (I.e. when I visit [github.com/ararchch/ip/tags](github.com/ararchch/ip/tags) I cannot see the tag), but I still am unable to create a new tag with the name `A-CodeQuality` on the correct commit.  

When i run: `git tag -a A-CodeQuality bee38a1` where `bee38a1` is my commit id, I get the error: `fatal: tag 'A-CodeQuality' already exists`

As such, I think the progress tracker is also unable to see the tag and hence reflect my actual level of completion.
I would appreciate any advice on what to do next because I do seem to have dug myself into a hole here.

Thank you so much!

https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/issues/158

**For Q3**:
The JSON Storage file we are using is currently still called `addressbook.json` when stored on the users target folder. However, our product name is now called 'MediCLI'. One of the issues raised in the PED referred to this difference. 

We were wondering if it was ok to change the storage file name to `medicli.json` to better align with our product. Functionality wise this is not really necessary, hence we sought to clarify.

Thanks a lot for clarifying!

So for my tp, currently attempting to type in a command, with prefixes that are empty will trigger an `illegalArgumentException`,
which then causes the app to stop functioning normally (i.e. future typed commands always show an empty list).

Is it OK to introduce code that performs a check on an empty prefix AND include a NEW error message to stop the app from silently failing by telling them a prefix is empty? 

(the user can't see that the app has stopped due to `illegalArgumentException` but rather sees that the app doesn't respond below)

Week 4 notes suggest that "A class implementing an interface results in an is-a relationship"

> Suppose SalariedStaff is an interface that contains two methods setSalary(int) and getSalary(). AcademicStaff can declare itself as implementing the SalariedStaff interface, which means the AcademicStaff class must implement all the methods specified by the SalariedStaff interface i.e., setSalary(int) and getSalary()

However I would like to propose another example that isn't as clear that 

Suppose IHasAbility is an interface that contains the method useAbility(). A healer is a game character that can declare itself as implementing the IHasAbility interface. Which means the Healer must implement the method useAbility(). Yet However, this doesn't mean a healer IS-A HasAbility. I would like to think of implements as a promise of features rather than a IS-A relationship.

Hi teaching team!

Our tp has a logging function. When the user enters a command, the app opens a pop up displaying the log list. 

However, during our internal testing, we realised that:
1. if the user adds a new log without closing the pop up, the new log does not get updated into the pop up
2. if the user enters the command to open the log window for person A, then, without closing the pop up, tries to use the command to open the log window for person B, the log window still logs for person A instead of person B. 
3. if the user minimizes the window, then tries to use the command, nothing happens and the window remains minimized.

These issues will be "solved" and the content will be updated if the user closes the log window after using the command before trying to open a new one.

Is it okay to fix this confusing behavior? Or should this be just written as a note in the UG?

Thank you so much in advance!

Hi Profs and TAs,

We have a bug that is high severity. Tester reported that they can add 2 exams with the same details to the same person but when deleting, they can only delete the first exam and the second exam is null so it cannot be deleted.

This is because current code used 2 data structures to represent the data, ObservableList and HashSet. Thus when duplicate exams are added, it can be added to ObservableList as separate objects but can only be added to HashSet once. Therefore HashSet can only contain unique exams. This caused a discrepancy between the two lists.

Are we allowed to 
(a) change the implementation of exam using HashSet. (Would require a lot of code changes as exam is used in many commands)
(b) change the implementation of ObservableList such that it no longer allow duplicates

Thank you

My team's intended jar file v1.3.1 unfortunately could not run for the PE dry run, though it seemed to be working when I tested it out locally.

From my understanding, the answer should be sequence diagrams instead. CCDs (Conceptual Class Diagrams) are a subset of class diagrams, so therefore class diagrams are technically a valid answer. However, sequence diagrams may touch on solution-specific classes, such as showing the interactions with a database, and therefore may not be too useful here.

When trying to add tasks, even though it acknowledges and remarks for wrong syntax, the program doesn't go forward when I try to input in a valid format. I do not receive acknowledgement of task added or otherwise. Error handling seems to be done for the tasks, however, it seems that the task itself isn't added or the text file to store the data isn't created on my end.

@chin-herng By "the program doesn't go forward", I meant that I did not receive any reply from the chatbot upon entering my input (the Send button does not seem to register the input). The directory containing the jar file does not have a bob.txt file, in which case I would recommend handling the case of "if .txt file not found, create a .txt file" and proceed there on.

However, it could also be a unique case on my laptop, so I would ask you to clarify with the rest who have put it through the smoke test as well.

Hope that helps!

you can do JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home on Terminal, if you want it to be permanent you can open your .zshrc file and write 
`export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-11.jdk/Contents/Home`
save it then type `source .zshrc` on terminal and it should be set that way each time you open terminal. (can check by typing echo $JAVA_HOME)

Can these two issues considered as a bug fix? The storage of our app is currently storing every fields except the group field. For this reason, group fields always display zero value when we restart the program, even though we set them into different value before exiting the program using command. Our storage is designed to store every user information, and this is different from advertised behavior.

I think because `process()` in `Foo` is not declared abstract, it is a concrete method. Because of this, since there is `process()` in `Bar` as well, it overrides the `process()` method in `Foo`, this is from inheritance. If it was meant to be the exact same method then there would be no `process()` in `Bar`.

Similar to @Jerome-j, I've also taken inspiration from [AB2 project](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level2). What I did was to have my parser return the respective Command class along with the relevant information/arguments.

You could get it to interact with storage or tasklist directly but I wouldn't recommend it as I think that the Parser purpose is to mainly parse user's input and direct them to where they are needed to be.

I encountered the same issue before. It could run with Intellj but not with Gradle. So what I do are:

1. Run Gradle clear, then try whether or not it could be run.
2. clear all the current projects, and classes that are shown at the top of the IntelliJ(on the left of the Run button)
3. run the main() method first, after that, if it runs successfully, then run the class.
4. Check your current project environment, whether it is default Java version 11, and Language Level is SDK default.
5. clear the data files(your load and save)
6. make sure the gradle setting is as same as website mentioned.

I am indeed not sure why this happen but these are what I do. The first time after implementing Gradle I had the same issue as you, and it happened several times later. Every time it happens, I just repeat the process. It somehow happened and somehow not. But most of the time run 3 first, and then run the whole class is successful.

Personally, I ended up creating a custom exception class because there were some common exceptions thrown such as index out of bounds errors that may throw the same exception but from different parts of the application. By creating a custom exception class from which we can extend specific exceptions helped me to differentiate both, although I'm sure there may be a better way to do this.

I followed the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/using-starter-workflows) to set up CI using GitHub Actions. This allows you to set up CI on GitHub directly instead of creating the directory .github/workflows and adding the gradle.yml file locally.
After clicking on `New workflow`, click on `set up a workflow for yourself`, then you can paste the code from gradle.yml inside.

From what I understand, distZip and distTar are both from the "distribution" plugin. A new "distribution" directory will be created and the [root_name].jar will be packaged into a zip and tar folder respectively.

dependsOn seems to reinforce an order in executing tasks.
A.dependsOn(B) would mean A can only run if B is done or present. This is different from mustRunAfter where A.mustRunAfter(B).
If both A and B are present, B runs first then A. However, if B is not present, A can still execute.

Do correct me if I am wrong!

I noticed that recently, some time in the past week, Codecov has stopped running its checks and commenting on our team's pull requests. Codecov still runs its checks when we merge the PR to the main branch and we can see the updated changes on the Codecov app so it should still have access to our repo. 

I'm not quite sure how to fix this or if this is intended behaviour, but if anyone has any idea or is experiencing the same thing that would be very helpful!

Yup had same issue. You need to set your minHeight for the dialog box. What's happening is the JavaFX is squeezing the dialog box to the minimum height possible, so it ends up truncating the text. This was the relevant commit that fixed it for me

Try running the tests using Intellij to check if the problem is with the test case code or your configuration of Gradle:
settings > build, execution, deployment > build tools > gradle and change the "run tests using" from gradle default to intellij 

If the issue is with your code itself, maybe try printing the NicoleException e in the catch block and using toString/getMessage to check if you are getting the right error message for your test

Happy lunar new year.

Based on the stacktrace you provided, I believe the error is caused by the null value being passed to instantiate a `javafx.scene.image.Image` object that is used in your fxml file. This is likely due to the image not being found on your file system.

If you are following the tutorial from the website, the issue is likely caused by missing profile picture(s) of your toothless chatbot and the user which causes the `getResourceAsStream` method to [return null](https://docs.oracle.com/en%2Fjava%2Fjavase%2F11%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2F%2F/java.base/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResourceAsStream(java.lang.String)) as your specified resource(s) are not found.

  `private final Image userImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));`
`private final Image dukeImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaDuke.png"));`

If that is indeed the issue, you may wish to follow my directory structure (referenced from the cs2103t website) which can be found [here ](https://github.com/jjchee77/ip/tree/master/src/main/resources)

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact issue without being able to see your code, but hope this helps.

Hi, I have submitted the release on time, but I recently made a minor bug fix to my code. I then pushed the most recent version to my fork and created a new JAR file. 

When I updated my release with the newer JAR file, it only showed the updated JAR file, but the source code was not updated as seen below. I encountered a similar issue when trying to create a new release as well.

Would that be alright or is there anything else I should be doing so that the source code is updated? Thank you!

Yes indeed, make sure that the master at the left (the branch you are merging to) belongs to your own repository. You should be able to see which branch belongs to which repo by clicking on the drop down list.

@Darkarche3 you have to create the new branch named `tutorial-adding-command` and follow the tutorial, committing the changes to that branch. When you push the branch to your fork and make a PR with that branch to your team repo, that should fulfil the tutorial tag in the tP tracker.

@TarinPairor I’m on Windows and had something similar to you before. I did not download any new SDK etc. After adding the dependencies stated in Part 1 of the tutorial to the `build.gradle` file, I closed my IDE (IntelliJ), ran `gradlew clean build` from the terminal (or `./gradlew clean build` in your case), and restarted IntelliJ. This was what worked for me.

Now, I have deleted all my duplicate files successfully, but I am still unable to `git pull` to get the latest version. It kept giving this error message as shown:

When searching for the branch, there was 'branch-addConditionForDelete', but not 'branch-addConditionForDelete 2'. Since my PR was merged already, I decided to delete this branch 'branch-addConditionForDelete'. However, the problem still persists. 

I tried to clone again, but I was still unable to `git pull` the latest version. 

May I know how to resolve this issue?
