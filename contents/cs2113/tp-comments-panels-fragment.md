Is there a way to implement this to allow for multiple payment targets as opposed to creating a transaction object for every payment target, i.e. arraylist for `to` and `amount`? Would be good if could add an attribute for transaction description as well for optional user input.

The whole purpose of the group structure was to avoid a case of name typos creating new name entries instead of flagging up the erroneous name as an error. Will require further implementation of `GroupList` but before that but do take note.

For now can just implement the `abstract` class itself, specific followup classes for individual commands can be left to those performing the implementation of the specific tasks. That way, the latter class can be used for task identification as well so we reduce clutter in this class.

Minor semantics but "Owner" of a transaction doesn't sounds quite right. Do you mind changing the term across the board to "Owed" instead.
Similar to previous comment, since we're referencing `String` type might be better to name the method as `isOwed` instead. Or even better would be to make the comparison using `Member` objects instead since you have implemented the `isEqual` method for `Member` class.
Let me work on my proposed changes first though, if you intend to work on the latter improvement.

Rename this to `findTransactions`. `findPayments` will be a different method that outputs the least transaction solutions ideally and should be in `MemberList` instead.

For debate, do you want to implement this together with the previous method? Might serve as a better gauge of all transactions a `Member` object has been involved in.

The point of the app is that it should simplify all the transactions though, so the list of transactions may not be indicative of who each `Member` needs to pay. I will approve the PR for now though, we can keep this as KIV.

Should this test be in TransactionListTest or TransactionTest? I believe we can extract the necessary info from the latter and would be neater to have it there.

Can look within our documents to check for standardisation of capital letters on this. `DD-MM-YYYY HHMM` seems more appropriate. Usually when characters are differentiated by captilisation it indicates that one is in numbers while the other is in words (i.e. dd-MMM-yyyy -&gt; 15-Apr-2024)

Similar to above, drop the activation box. Current diagram with it is incorrect as activation box does not end. Also, class headers require a preceding colon, i.e. `:Transaction` as opposed to `Transaction`. This can be done using `":Transaction"` to parse in the colon as part of the class name.

Oh yes one more thing, will need to organise the classes into packages.
A lot of attributes are also missing their supposed `this` declarations, so this will need to be fixed as well.

I prioritised getting the main functionality up so that I could test the solving algo first so there are some issues that will need to be solved subsequently.
Current issues pending fix as of push in this PR:
1. Re-implement commented-out functions. Functions were commented out due to changes in some class architecture which affected the implementation of these functions. In the interest of time, I left it commented.
2. Clean up code and extract more code into their own functions or classes.
3. The current implementation of solving algo is long, will try to think of where I can further extract portions out.
4. I have not fully tackled some exceptions, especially checks for length of `ArrayList` greater than 0 leading to `IOOBE`. Will work on it next week instead.

I emphasise this code is to get key functionality up so that we can hopefully have a basis for doing JUnit tests. Do reference some of the coding styles I have adopted however if you wish to.

Few comments: 
1. possible to either break the addManager line into two lines (using `\n`) or to exclude the method parameters? Currently the picture is quite wide, making it hard to read.
2. Remove the footbox as it is not part of course conventional notation. Use `hide footbox` in your PUML file.

Issue seems to be within findDateFromDayNumber; ~it is handled in the else branch (when in weekView) but not handled when in monthView~
Upon testing, the issue seems to be in line 441, since we add dayInt directly to the start of the month, so there is one extra day. 

Good catch on the bug! Will work on a fix now.

If I'm not wrong, the `.remove(int index)` method for a List will return us the removed element, so we can probably consider removing the previous line.

Good usage of assertion (given our assumption that data will not be corrupted)!

BTW, in a future version, we could probably consider letting the user continue to use the application on a clean state, even if the data file is corrupted.  If this is the case, then we probably shouldn't use an assertion here, as I believe this will cause the application to forcefully quit.

Since `Files.readAllLines()` returns a `List&lt;String>`, I believe we can pass this into the constructor for an `ArrayList` to get `ArrayList&lt;String>`, instead of directly typecasting it. If I'm not wrong, this approach of using the constructor is safer (w.r.t type safety).

I notice that only the `ByeCommand` will use the `Ui` object to call `setUserAsInactive()`. Other `Command` objects will have access to the `Ui`, but they are not using it in `execute()`.

I was thinking whether it might be better for us to keep the original implementation (i.e., to call `setUserAsInactive()` in this class instead of in `ByeCommand`)? This is because passing in the `Ui` object as a method argument creates an additional dependency that can probably be avoided (IMO, a `Command` doesn't really need to have any dependency/knowledge of a `Ui`).

For update by name, if you're ever considering only updating the first occurrence of the `Item` with a duplicated name, then you can probably insert a `break` here to avoid updating everything else. Though I'm not sure if that's a good solution either.

Should the name option and index option be required? Then we could place them in an `OptionGroup` to enforce that either `-n` or `-i` must be specified in the command. Currently it seems like you can just call `update` without specifying any options, which is quite odd.

The naming for this method might not be appropriate. Given this method name, I would expect this method to only check if the corrupted file was renamed, and return a boolean value to indicate whether the file was indeed renamed (like a getter method).

My suggestion is that you could perhaps rename this method to something like `renameCorruptedFile()` instead? It can still return a boolean value to indicate the success/failure of the operation. Then the assignment to `boolean isRenamed` in `handleCorruptedFile()` will still make sense.

It doesn't seem like you're explicitly creating `Quote` objects using the constructor. In that case, you can probably keep the constructor private.

That is a valid approach as well! I was actually not sure if I should've went with that approach instead, for the sake of simplicity.

Anyway, the idea behind this Optional approach was to allow us to simply view every Item as an `Item`.
In this approach, I don't have to care if an item has an expiration date or not. I can always call `itemExpirationDate` and expect to get something (either the date value, or an `N.A.`). In this approach I can rest assured that I will never run into `NullPointerExceptions` or other similar errors.

However, this approach [doesn't seem too correct either](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29033518/is-it-a-good-practice-to-use-optional-as-an-attribute-in-a-class), as I'm not really using the `Optional` as per its intended purpose. I feel like it is quite overcomplicated as well.

Does this change still enforce the proper ordering of flags? That is, `q/` must still come before `e/`?

I tried to swap the order of flags, and for the `EXPIRATION_DATE` field, it read the provided argument + everything in `QUANTITY`. So I got a regex match of `&lt;EXPIRATION_DATE> q/&lt;ITEM_QUANTITY>`. Was this the error you previously mentioned?

## Update - 25/03/2024:
* `Optional&lt;LocalDate>` is no longer used to represent the `itemExpirationDate` attribute in `Item`. This attribute now only belongs to `Item` classes that are Perishable. Attribute type is now a `LocalDate`.
* `LocalDate.MIN` is used as an "invalid" placeholder value for `itemExpirationDate` at parsing stage. `ItemList` will determine if an item is perishable using this `LocalDate.MIN` value. If a valid `LocalDate` is provided, then the item is deemed to be perishable. 
* `toString()` output has been modified. Items with no expiration date will not have any expiration date field present in their String representation. Likewise, items with no sale price should not see any sale price field in their String representation as well.
* `itemSalePrice` attribute has been moved to `RetailItem`.

I feel it would be natural for people to assume that the upper limit is included when searching for items below a certain price.

Perhaps this portion could be replaced directly with calling of `itemList.get(index - 1)` once, followed by the respective setter methods of each quantity. 

While I agree that this may increase the length of this method (especially for itemSalePrice and itemExpirationDate where instance checking is required, I feel it shouldn't increase the length of the method by too much. I may be wrong on this.)

However, I recognize the need for method abstraction for purposes of unique logging and instance checking. So this suggestion may be ignored 😄

Given that the `Item` object, corresponding to the item that is to be updated, is already obtained either in 
- L87: `item = itemList.getItemList().get(index - 1);`, or
- L90: `item = itemList.findItemByName(itemName);`

A possible way to refactor this would be to create a general method in `ItemList`, which can be named `updateItem`. This method would take in an `Item` object instead of a String (itemName) or an int (index). This could reduce the need for 2 seperate methods within `ItemList`, the method overloading for updating each field, and possibly make this method shorter.

`updateItemDataByName` and `updateItemDataByIndex` have largely the same behaviour, sharing similar lines of code as can be seen in **L118-127** & **L135-144**

Perhaps you could refactor the common functionality into a separate method and call it from both methods, passing the `Item` object as a parameter. This also adheres with the DRY coding principle, and ensures that if the update logic ever needs to change in the future, you'll only need to update it in one place.

I agree with the second paragraph! We have to think of a concrete way to display profits for the following:
- Multiple items with the same name (but different UID)
- Items that do not generate revenue (such as operational items)

However, for the first paragraph, can I clarify if you meant `totalUnitsPurchased` and `totalUnitsSold` (for the RetailItem class) ?
`totalRevenue` and `totalCost` are private variables, representing the total revenue and total cost of the user's entire inventory. They are stored in an ItemList class (which I assume will only be instantiated once throughout the lifetime of the program)

Each item having a `totalUnitsPurchased` (and potentially a `totalUnitsSold`) variable gives us the flexibility to come up with methods to calculate `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` in the future.

Additionally, if we are going this route (which I support) consider abstracting more attributes away from Item to its subclasses. In addition to `itemExpirationDate` as suggested by @imanamirshah , `itemSalePrice` can be defined under RetailItem.

Rather than having class-agnostic calls, I see it as more sensible to enforce `getItemExpirationDate` only be called on subclasses that have this attribute. Since the benefit of Optional is unclear to me, I am not sure if it is worth the extra handling checks necessary to make it work.

These methods obscure readability since the body seems to do something unrelated to what the name suggests. Rather than returning the value of hasOption in each one (which is trivially _true_ anyway), consider declaring `hasOption` as a class attribute and have these methods set that to true. Then they can be of return type void with clearer method names.

Your concerns on coupling are valid. The intent is to make this dependency explicit for commands that do need to know of a `Ui`. Aside from _bye_, this includes _list_ and _search_ whose execution depend on writing some output to a user facing interface.
Other commands such as _add_ and _delete_ operate primarily on `itemList` and write to output only as feedback. I agree these commands do not need to know of a Ui object.
Taking into account your suggestions, what do you think of only passing in required objects based on a Command type?

This error is likely not caused by an inability to parse a large integer. Rather, it is wrongfully indicating that the command is malformed due to an invalid number when it is really because the `-d` option is missing.

This can be moved to the unused folder as mentioned by Clarence. In addition, we can follow the same folder naming standard as our actual code. Nicholas has placed his unused classes in a ui folder within unused. We should similarly add our unused code belonging to a certain package into a folder with the same name within the unused folder.

Good job on handling the exception, but do note that you should avoid catching generic exception and explicitly specify the exact exception type that will be caught. Also, it would be better practice to scope the try catch to the lines that will throw the exception.

```suggestion
        String[] medicineInformation = arguments.split(" ");
        try ``{``
            medicationName = medicineInformation[MED_NAME];
            medicineQuantity = medicineInformation[MED_QTY];
            medicineDosage = medicineInformation[MED_DOSAGE];
            expiryDate = medicineInformation[MED_EXP];
            intakeFreq = medicineInformation[MED_FREQ];
            remarks = medicineInformation[MED_RMK];
        ``}`` catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) ``{``

Good job on using Enums to handle the different `Command` types. Just a suggestion, since the value of the enum name are the same, you could just use `Enum.valueOf` and convert the label to `label.toUpperCase()` so you don't have to store additional attribute and also iterate through in a `for` loop.

```suggestion
    public static CommandName valueOfLabel(String label) ``{``
        try ``{``
            return CommandName.valueOf(label.toUpperCase());
        ``}`` catch (IllegalArgumentException e) ``{``
            return null;
        ``}``

I made the design choice to use Exception to break the normal execution of code so that additional checks of nullity is not required outside of the `ArgumentList`/`ArgumentParser` classes. Additional code just need to be written to handle the exception outside of these classes instead. The printing of help messages can be done so using the static methods `ArgumentHelper.getHelpMessage(CommandName)` or `ArgumentHelper.getHelpMessage(CommandName, ArgumentList)`

There are indeed multiple issues with the command, but as it can be seen in the screenshot, fixing the given error message, which is the unknown argument flag found, will prompt the duplicate flag found in the subsequent attempt. This is a non-issue and both issues can be identified by the code.

Unable to determine the state of the daily medication list so we are unable to understand the cause of the corruption of data. The last issue stated about the modified medication not being reflected has since been rectified in #221.

The exception class InvalidCostException has been added properly. It extends GitException, which fits the design of having a hierarchy of exceptions in the application. The message "Please input a valid cost!" is clear and provides straightforward feedback to the user.

The addition of the cost attribute and corresponding methods (setCost and getCost) are implemented correctly. The printGrocery method has been updated to include cost information, which aligns with the feature's requirements.
Consider validating the cost in the setCost method to ensure it's a positive value, as negative costs might not be meaningful in this context.

The renaming of exceptions (e.g., WrongFormatException to CommandWrongFormatException, IncompleteCommandException to IncompleteParameterException) improves clarity regarding the exceptions' contexts. This makes it easier for developers to understand what each exception represents without delving into their implementations. Well done!

The transition to more specific file handling methods (loadGroceryFile, saveGroceryFile, loadRecipeFile, saveRecipeFile) is commendable for its clarity and future-proofing, as it allows further expansion, like adding more data types to handle.
Catching FileNotFoundException in loadRecipeFile without printing a message may silently fail. Consider logging this event or handling it in a way that informs the user or system about the missing file, improving fault tolerance.

Thank you for your insights. While it is possible to check for corrupted files (aka files that have been directly edited in this case), we feel that it would not be wise to completely wipe the entire file automatically for the user, just in case the user wishes to salvage the data. To partially address the issue you have brought up, we have added additional comments in our user guide FAQ to guide users on what to do in the event they find that their files have become corrupted due to them manually editing the text files. Thanks

Ok, rebasing this is not a good idea. This is what happens when you rebase. Basically, what happens is you cherry-pick all the commits and place them into one line.

Both `saveDailyMedicationData()` and `loadDailyMedicationData()` are static and can be called directly via `FileReaderWriter`.

For the saving, it is on demand. meaning the saving has to be called explicitly in code, but it can be called anywhere in the code so long as you have a `List&lt;String>` to save. Existing data saved will be deleted.

As for the loading, it is supposed to be called in `MediTracker` when the program first starts up. Since I have merged in the recent changes, let me introduce the addition in MediTracker for your review. (Implemented in ce6033237c33c73adad68394f1e59e572fa2071d and 4b7af551c1e976b5ff56532c4d91a8c022083e20)

I am seeing this as a non-issue, since a command without arguments (when at least one valid compulsory one is needed) is seen as an invalid command. And the way we deal with invalid commands is to print out the help message.

Though, I am thinking we can describe to the user better (i.e. Incomplete command, Invalid command Syntax, Invalid Argument value etc) the error via the various *ArgumentException messages.

Basically
- User enters the wrong command
- We tell them what is wrong
- Show them the correct format

1. As per discussion just now, there will be a few possible cases during the import process from JSON to `DailyMedicationmanager` (DailyMgr)

2. The core idea is to preserve (past) daily medication data for the future implementation of being able to retrieve taking of medication history (Name, taken, dosage), even if the medication no longer exist in the `MedicationManager` (MedMgr). On that note, DailyMgr will have to refer to MedMgr on a best-effort basis rather than a fail-if-not-found idea. (Remove the assumption that what is on the today list is also on the main list)

3. Possible cases of corruption

Case 1.1: JSON is corrupt and is unable to recover any data but the daily txt file is not corrupt
- In this case, the MedMgr will start from a clean state
- DailyMgr will try to read from the MedMgr on a best-effort basis to get the dosage information, failing which will show "unknown"

Case 1.2: JSON is partially corrupt (able to recover some data) but the daily txt file is not corrupt
- In this case, the JSON will load whatever data that is not corrupt and places a placeholder value for fields not present or corrupt for the MedMgr to load
- DailyMgr will still try to read from the MedMgr on a best-effort basis to get the dosage information, failing which will show "UNKNOWN"

Case 2: Json is not corrupt, Daily txt file is corrupt
- MedMgr loads as per normal
- DailyMgr will try to load in a best-effort basis and still read from the MedMgr thereafter on a best-effort basis to get dosage infromation.


4. Things of things to mention in the User Guide
- a.  That the DailyMgr function "separately" from the MedMgr; That some data (except dosage information) can still be shown even if there is no MedMgr. Put a note over the "list -t today", "take" and "untake" commands to remind users that those are still available even when there is no medication information.
- b. With regards to corrupt data: That the program will still try to load whatever data that is available, but may have fields missing, or start with a clean slate
- c. It will be helpful to inform the user that DailyMgr and MedMgr function mostly separately and independently of each other (and introduce their individual roles in 1-2 sentence), that other side will still work even if one side is missing.
- d. Under the `list -t` command, mention that the `all` and `today` results are separate; that information of one does not affect the information of the other.

5. Mention with comments below whichever part is closed once implemented

One area to fix is in the JSON exporting, where if there are other commands relying on the export but still passes in `infinity` value due to them not being handled, then the JSONExport should catch it and drop the entry from saving


The other area to fix is in the way the `add` (and `modify`) command handles the user's input of large numbers (they are indicated as `infinity`. The suggestion is that the `Medication` setters validate those fields and not allow creation of any entries that has the value of `infinity`.

```
if (root == null) ``{``
    assert false;
    return false;
``}``
```

While that is true, there is a few reasons why this chunk is like this. one is that that root of the filesystem should also be present in the `root` variable (it should never be null) and that the return is also present in case the flag to check for assert statements are removed.

Still, asserts can cause crashes and I guess given the scope of the project, this unexpected behaviour can be handled more gracefully instead of just crashing.

Sry! I might not have been clear earlier. 
If user can specify the dosage to be taken at each time (morning, afternoon and evening), then I think that would already imply the intakeFreq in a single day. Yes?

Otherwise, when we have them together, u might have to include a new check to see when user specify -dM -dA, then the intakeFreq should be 2. It can cause confusion if user accidentally specify intakeFreq other than 2, leading to extra error.
I just think this will introduce extra redundant steps for u.

I mean in the context of untaking a medication (which usually happens when they accidentally check off the wrong meds), the message saying "increase medication quantity" is not a deliberate/intentional from user. 
So it could lead to the user questioning "why am I trying to increase medication quantity? I am just trying to uncheck the medicine."
So in a sense, that information is not necessary to inform them.

@wenenhoe 
I believe this is due to misunderstanding that the "take" index is referencing the number from MedMgr, when it is actually the index from DailyMgr list. So need to be clearer on the UG and error message, and to ask user to see "list -t today" instead.

Hi Nidhi, I think you can return out from the if block, and start the main code without using an 'else'. this will help in preventing arrow-head code.

```suggestion
        if (recipes.isEmpty()) ``{``
            System.out.println("Sorry, you have no recipes to find matches with. Try adding some!");
            return;
        ``}``
        // main code here

Lambda expressions may help to reduce length of code here too.

You can consider the .filter() method.

You may also extract the method that simply prints the matches. I'm not too familiar with StringBuilder, but I think you can achieve something similar by looping or using forEach (lambda expression).

Actually, you could consider moving the UI.printMessage from the AddRecipeCommand into the executeCommand method in RecipeList.java, inside the case function.

That way, the printMessage is only called when executeCommand is called, i.e. when the user adds a recipe.

Hopefully that will solve the Text Ui test error you're getting.

The prerequite says nothing about whether a recipe with date 2025-03-03 is added. So, you can't conclude that this is the expected output.

Oh i see, you have indented the user input instead. I think I missed out on this PR comment entirely, and went directly to files changed, sorry about that! These changes all seem valuable, but it'll be helpful for any reviewer to focus a PR on only one topic. That way we reduce the chance of overlooking any of them.

I don't know about others, but I like it when I see 5 or even 10 PRs, where each of them just touch maybe 2 or 3 files. Approving and merging them is surprisingly easy, as merge conflicts (if any) is small and easy to resolve. Anyways PRs coming from the same person shouldn't cause merge conflicts with each other, if you think about it.

Static constants are unable to be abstracted. I've considered alternatives but am unable to figure out how to resolve this issue. Advice would be appreciated.

Alternatives:
1) Using an interface for static constants.
    Concerns:
    - If using polymorphism to loop, will require passing in a command instance. This is not ideal as it is a static variable and I do not wish to create instances unnecessarily.
    - Considered bad practice
    
2) Declare all the command details in the `Help` class or a new `CommandDetails` class.
    Concerns:
    - All the variables will need to have different names. i.e. `NEW_COMMAND_KEYWORD`, `EDIT_COMMAND_KEYWORD`. This will still result in the same issue whereby the function is called multiple times but with different variables.

User guide did specify that parameters must be in specified order. Link to section "Notes about the Command Format": https://ay2324s2-cs2113t-t09-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#features

However, noted that the section is not obvious enough and will consider making it a section instead of sub-section.

Before anyone merges this pull request could @dtaywd please explain why `REVERSE_FLAG = "r"` was removed? Perhaps this was an oversight?
A possible fix would be to add `REVERSE_FLAG = "r"` back into the code, and change `REPORT_TYPE_FLAG` to  `REPORT_TYPE_FLAG = "rp"`.

Regarding the "assigned" vs "assign", it is because the command is meant to be `week /assign &lt;workout name> /to &lt;day>`.

Might also change the error message.

You are doing syntax checking here, which is not wrong, but the use of a regex string could simplify syntax checking.  (one regex string can replace several lines of code).  

For example, instead of creating this function, you can first assume that the user input direction is correct and parse directly, then enter the regex string into SyntaxAnalyser, ensuring that the row number matches with the command order in CommandList.

Refer to the guide I sent in the Telegram group and skip to the Q&A section question 2 for more details.

Formatter.printMatchResults() seems to be a better name, because the Formatter is in the if block where the statement already implies the match is over. Also, it is unclear what is printed after the match whereas the suggested name change explicitly states so.

Is this supposed to be the implementation for managing different player accounts and cache player data ? If so I don't think that is related to the feature you're working on. Also, that is not how you save the game state and is supposed to be my part.

Would it be better to use values from DayStrings here and implement this with String.format? (this is a genuine question because your current implementation works better for readability and other tests do also use this implementation, but Joshua also refactored many things into strings package, so I'm not sure)

In accordance with @joshualeejunyi's recommendations, made all methods in Validator classes static and removed instantiations. Also added author tags to credit authors of methods from which Validators methods were extracted - **please check these tags to ensure these are correct** as I used already existing author tags, but also IntelliJ authorship records (which could be wrong).

Hi, thank you for the suggestion! The purpose of the Fitness Motivator is actually to provide some suggestions and a tracking feature for the users with regards to what exercises can be done, rather than a tool for them to create their own list, hence why the delete function serves to only delete individual exercises. It does remain a rather good idea to implement it as an additional feature for future versions, however due to time constraints we will not implement this feature.

1) It's for our debugging purpose to catch some unhandled error cases, we will remove that in our final product

2) We will consider this change in our future iterations

3) For this one the user input is received in way that it will prompt the user to type Transaction type first and then followed by other data one by one, where each data will be received separately. I have included the relevant function below. Correct me if I took the question wrongly.

Yes, it will be an integer always. For now, it has been caught if other numbers or text is typed instead. I have attached one example below. We will make a check explicitly in our future iterations. Thank you for notifying this.

Hi Vishruti! Sflr but thanks for the feedback. Could I check by one-shot command you mean instead of executing the command in steps and prompting the user for input in each step, I just expect a 1 liner input to call the main command instead?

ie:
> user: "edit [student] [subject] [name]" 
> program: prompt for new subject name
> user: enter "new name"
> program: success

instead of currently:
>user: enter "edit"
> program:  prompt for student 
>user: enter "student"
> program:  prompt ....
> user: enter....
> program:  prompt...
>user: enter...
>program:  success

However, as mentioned in the 'Guidelines for determining bugs ' under 'Functionality Bugs' ([linked here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#3-polish-the-deliverables)), this is an _extreme_ user behavior, and as it does not crash the app or corrupt the data, it is not considered a bug.

Yes we do allow initial balance to be negative as we let customers add credit card accounts as well which can have negative balances. 

Furthermore, in terms of the max value, the amount you have entered is considered as an _extreme_ user behavior, as mentioned in the 'Guidelines for determining bugs ' under 'Functionality Bugs' ([linked here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s2.github.io/website/schedule/week12/project.html#3-polish-the-deliverables)).

Thanks Wen En. Apologies for my poor understanding but could you elaborate further? The rationale of storing the attributes first is so that they could be passed together into the Medication constructor together to create the Medication object. 

Or are you suggesting that I should create my Medication object here and return it at the end?

I think the exception can be thrown in the parse and execute method? I tried to scope them out but invalid input will lead to runtime error.

Thanks for the suggestion. I have implemented and tried prior to this commit and faced other issues. One of it is the error when user supplied an invalid input, the toUpperCase() will fail and it leads to an exception which is the super class of NumberFormatException. Hence, the error handling may not be as specific and leads to other complications.

I believe the method is necessary because when reading in user input using nextLine(), the command is read in as a string. Hence parsing from string to double is still necessary.

Accessing payeeInfo[1] is cause of ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
the parseFloat function is cause of NumberFormatException

Should separate out the try block into payeeInfo[1] and parseFloat so it's clearer where exceptions are thrown - maybe check payeeInfo.size() > 1 in one try block, then parseFloat() in another try block

i think for this we should trim the userInput in case of leading spaces. also this doesn't account for an uppercase "LIST" which should work. 

try something like if userInput.tolowercase.startsWith("list") && userInput.trim().length() != 4

I just added this try-catch in case there is some issue with saving file (instead of the program shutting down, it should print an error saying it failed to save) -&gt; increases usability. i think it serves some purpose (unlike the last one of MAX_RECIPES, but do you think different?)

wait little confused on this. i dont understand how? it's erroring because there is no url (URL_INDEX var is 5). so its treating "egg dairy" as one parameter of allergies? 

i might have interpretted this wrong though. do you mind explaining it a bit more. i'll get started on working on a solution once i understand what's wrong. (of course i should add some error handling and a better message rather than the index out of bounds error) @yuki-zmstr

Good work in trying to display unrestricted electives MCs!

One issue with this, currently your UE MC remaining calculation relies on matching the courseCode directly with what is in the list which is mostly sufficient.

However specifically for a normal CEG student, the GE pillar courses are quite varied. 

For your method, adding something like "GEC1015" or "USE2310" **will both count under UE**, even though taking **either one of it** should count under "Cultures and Connections (GEC)" pillar. 

If we take both "GEC1015" and "USE2310", one of them will be considered under UE, while the other will be considered under GEC pillar.

Can read the whole GE pillar list from here: https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/general-education/list-of-courses-approved-under-the-ge-pillars

If this is too troublesome, then i think its better to just not calculate the UE's remaining, and just display the graduation list as it is

maybe you can make 'String filepath' take in from the argument? Like 'loadModulesFromFile(String filepath)'
to maintain consistency with the method 'saveModulesToFile(String filepath)'

Actually now that I think abt it, JsonManager could as well just have a method that can return 'new Module(moduleCode, moduleMC, moduleDate, moduleDescription);'

Can you help me refactor, by replacing my original constructor code so that the constructor method will not repeat. Please read through the code diff. This works on my end, but please test this code as well!

Sure, refactoring could make it more readable, but I do not think it is possible to avoid nested loops. Iterating over rows (max no. of modules per sem) and columns (total semesters) to print in table format inherently involves some form of nested iteration. 

If i do pull out the inner loop code into another method, i would need to pass in parameters to the new method such as 'startSem', 'endSem', 'moduleBySemMap' as well as the row 'index' (which is 'j' in this code above). Given the nature of the task is to print out a table, showing this as a nested loop seems appropriate and refactoring might not offer significant benefits in terms of code clarity or maintainability, since it is likely I would not be using the inner loop method outside of this table printing method anyways. Thanks for the comment anyways!

Good use of inheritance! Allows us to define more subclasses so that our application can be utilized by a wider range of businesses

I see that you have added itemExpirationDate as an Optional. Is this better than defining the Item class without an itemExpirationDate and putting it as an attribute of subclasses that inherit from this Item class? What are the pros of doing this over the latter?

Seems like you are instantiating a new `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` for each instance of an item. This would mean that for duplicate items that potentially are of a different batch (i.e. have a different UID) , the `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` will be separate from other items with the same name (correct me if I'm wrong) and will hence start from 0. Users may want to view the profits of items as a whole (meaning if we have three different items called milo, the store owner would sometimes prefer to see the profit for milo in general instead of the profits for each batch of milo).

Lets find a way display the profit margins of the items as a whole rather than for each instance of an item with the same name. Perhaps we can instantiate the values for `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` for future batches of a duplicate item to be the same as the current `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` of the existing item with the same name. Or we can have a method that calculates these values for all batches of the same item if we would like to maintain the profit margins for each batch of item.

Perhaps can consider using an enumeration here so that we do not switch case by string. I think we have to also look at our `Parser` class. If I recall correctly, we are still implementing switch case by string as well.

The long arguments that are passed into the constructor here are mostly repeated for all the items, thus making your switch case look long. Perhaps before the flow enters your switch case, you can define these long arguments as shorter variables, and pass these variables into your constructor so that it can reduce the length of your switch case and make it look more readable. Nothing major, just to improve code readability.

Oh thanks for noticing the typo. Will make the edits soon. As for the item's `toString()`, it should be printed out. Do check my `UpdateCommand` class.

A simple profit analysis will be implemented for v2.0. 

Class-level attributes of `totalRevenue` and `totalCost` will be added to `ItemList` class. Whenever an item is restocked, the total cost price will be added to the `totalCost`. Whenever an item is sold, its total sale price will be added to `totalRevenue`.

Lets find a way to display `totalProfit`. It can either be displayed every time the application is started, or it can be implemented as a separate command to show all the relevant information such ash `totalRevenue`, `totalCost` and `totalProfit`.

Will rectify this. Issue is due to downcasting item to retail item upon sell and restock. This was implemented before operational item subclass was adopted. Hence, downcasting does not handle operational items, resulting in uncaught exceptions. I am looking into it now.

Operational items in the inventory are not meant for sale. I will implement a check for item type upon sell and restock commands. If an operational item is attempted to be sold, it will instead alert users that the item cannot be sold and prompt users for another input.

Thanks for the feedback prof! Will take a look at it and make the edits. Can I check what you mean by too long? Do you mean that the line is close to exceeding the 120 character limit? Or do you mean that there are lines which span over 3 lines because it takes in many parameters etc.

Complete menu works now, the problem was with the definition of the enum constants. Two enum constants cannot share the same String values. The code has been restructured such that the "complete" command word can be used in both the menu and order sub logics.

Hi, unfortunately the team disagrees that this is a feature flaw. Adding spaces for better readability not only is an opinion rather than a flaw, but also introduces potential bugs such as resizing issues. While the team will not be moving forward with this, I do appreciate your diligence in looking out for bugs!

As of v2.0 for wellness360, the intended feature currently for the command “focus set” only allows users to set the timing in minutes. This was also explicitly stated in the user guide. Your suggestion will definitely add value to future versions but currently at v2.0 this will not be considered. Thanks.

Thanks for the suggestion. Your suggestion will greatly improve the application in future version. However, as of V2.1, we will not be adding an additional overall help function for wellness360. The user guide will be made readily available together with the wellness360 application when released and the concern that you have will unlikely be an issue. Furthermore, the individual features have it's own help function.

- dont need to specify super within seq diagram i think, can just say `new(date)` and `new()` 
- i think we need to change parser in the Gym class to gymParser to prevent confusion withn the parser created from Handler
- your workoutlist needs to be 'new' first, then you can call `addGym()` 
- workoutlist and parser life line is missing.

- remove validation class if not needed
- change the colour of activation bar for `splitGymStationInput()` to red for clarity
- change method name from `validateParameters` to something like `checkGymStationParameters`, `validateParameters` is a bit vague, and also `validate` is the naming convention for `validation` class methods.

This is an intended feature. We noticed that popular apps like Garmin actually do not have some niche exercises, and users are confined to a pre-defined list.

As such, we let the user indicate the name of the exercise, and there is only a check for the type of exercise done. Additionally, there are too many exercises to include for each user profile.

Code is very well organised! I think we can improve on throwing exceptions here:

```
        if (parts.length != 2) ``{``
            System.out.println("Invalid input format. Please enter in the correct format.");
            return;
        ``}``
```
I think we should throw our CustomExceptions here!

For example:

```
throw new CustomExceptions(Constant.UNSPECIFIED_PARAMETER);
```

And here as well, to avoid using magic strings! :

```
        ``}`` catch (NumberFormatException e) ``{``
            System.out.println("Invalid value entered. Please try again.");
        ``}``
```
I shall help to implement some of the code to assist you! I'll keep in touch :)

# *After review here's what you can try*

Instead of this:
```
try ``{``
            if (parts[0].equals("height")) ``{``
                Health.height = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                System.out.printf("Your height is %.2fm.", Health.height);
            ``}`` else ``{``
                Health.weight = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                System.out.printf("Your weight is %.2fkg.", Health.weight);
            ``}``
            Health.printNewLine();
```

Do this:
```
try ``{``
            if (parts[0].equals("height")) ``{``
                Health.height = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                System.out.println(String.format("Your height is %.2fm.", Health.height)); //Replace with println
            ``}`` else ``{``
                Health.weight = Double.parseDouble(parts[1]);
                System.out.println(String.format("Your weight is %.2fkg.", Health.weight)); //Replace with println
            ``}``
```

Which should give the same result as intended. Happy coding!

On account of the suggestion I made to remove the `Health.printNewLine();` statement:

```
public static void calculateBmi() ``{``
        double bmi = Health.weight / (Math.pow(Health.height, 2.0));
        System.out.printf("Your BMI is %.2f", bmi);
        Health.printNewLine();
        printBmiCategory(bmi);
    ``}``
```

Can be refactored as:
```
public static void calculateBmi() ``{``
        double bmi = Health.weight / (Math.pow(Health.height, 2.0));
        System.out.println("Your BMI is %.2f", bmi);
        printBmiCategory(bmi);
    ``}``
```

That should also make the code much tidier. Happy coding!

Why are we using an abstract class here instead of an interface? To my knowledge the benefit of abstract classes is to have non-public methods/fields, static methods/fields, and to be able to initialize the abstract class itself, but I'm not sure if we're utilizing any of that.

I feel like we should excessively handle possible user inputs. For example if the user types "delete ``{``tab``}`` 1" instead of using a space, then the `split(" ")` won't work. Maybe we could consider splitting by whitespace using regex.

I think feedback after a command should be prettyPrint. I think we'll end up refactoring most of the Error handling so I left that how it is for now

The issue is most probably linked to the hash not matching up with the data file. 

1. Include a more descriptive handling of the hash file not matching with the data file causing a full corruption 
2. User guide properly reflect the different scenario of a partial and full corruption 

@L5-Z can take note of this.

I think you might have seen wrongly in the user guide. It clearly states that the command is "**program /assign &lt;WORKOUT_PLAN_NAME [string]> /to &lt;DAY [string]>**" . You have missed out the "**/**" for the "**to**" arguments.

Below is an image of the UserGuide showing the correct command.

> The style check cannot pass due to the original file cannot pass. Some magic param in original version before my push cannot pass the style check, please have a look at the style about DELETE_PADDING and SIZE_OF_DELETE in CalorieList.java and LiquidList.java, gradle shows them wrong. So I have to change them to deletePadding and sizeOfDelete...

ideally constants should be in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` as per coding standards, i think we should find a workaround for this in gradle instead of changing our constant names, will raise an issue for this

Should the "Create menu" arrow point to `MainLogic` instead since it's a `MainLogic` command? Then perhaps the `MainLogic` can then call the static method MenuLogic.modifyMenu() as seen in the code snippet below?

You have a point. However, the responsibility of the QuoteCommand class is to encapsulate the behavior of generating and executing a quote-related action. Although the logic for generating a random message could be separated into another class, it's still related to the functionality of QuoteCommand and doesn't introduce significant complexity or violation of single responsibility principle. Moreover, separating this logic into another class might lead to unnecessary proliferation of small classes, potentially making the codebase harder to navigate.

The Ui class handles user interface-related functionality. Generating a random message fits within the scope of user interaction, but while it could be argued that generating random messages is not strictly related to user interface tasks, it's still a lightweight operation and doesn't significantly deviate from the overall purpose of the Ui class.

While it's true that the getRandomMessage function is primarily used by QuoteCommand, it's also a form of user interaction that is used elsewhere in the application, when it is provided on startup. Placing it in the Ui class ensures that it's readily available for any future UI-related functionalities that might require similar functionality. Additionally, keeping related functions together can improve code organization and maintainability, as it centralizes related functionalities within a single class.

Adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle, where high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules directly, it's beneficial to maintain loose coupling between components. Although QuoteCommand currently doesn't interact with ItemList, its dependency on ItemList provides flexibility. This promotes loose coupling between components, making the codebase easier to maintain and modify.

That is true, but the current implementation provides a necessary initialization step for the QuoteCommand. By setting the Ui instance for the QuoteCommand before execution, we ensure that the command has access to the necessary UI functionality to generate and display quotes. This initialization step ensures proper functioning of the QuoteCommand and makes it behaves correctly within the application context. While it may seem like an extra step, it's a part of the command's setup process and does not significantly impact the readability or maintainability of main().

Looks good to me but for your Junit testing you can consider directly creating the command and executing it instead of using parser. This way if there is an issue it isolates it to just the command instead of a potential problem with parser.

Feel that it should be inside TransactionListTest since we have done similar listing tasks under the class previously.

On the other hand, I believe contains is already a good enough approach. I'm quite reluctant to use the exact expression as it increases coupling which could be troublesome. For instance, if we were to tidy up the format of listing in later parts e.g. include a dash line separation, all these previous test cases would need to be rectified again.

As for the issue of unwanted characters, we can further mitigate this issue with further improvements of text-ui-tests as we gradually reach the end of the v2.0 development

Testing of all commands works on my end except for finding debts NAME & find transactions NAME. 
1) Find debts includes entries where the member to search is a lender.
2) Find transactions include entries where the member to search is a borrower.

For instance,
Pre search commands:

Would be good if such problems were solved to maintain consistency with previous program behaviors.

Entry is done through user input with the keyword /t: &lt;i>e.g. add transaction Jack p/John a/200 t/2024-11-29 2359&lt;/i>
The time parameter is entirely optional, and a transaction can still be added without a transaction time.

Feels like this issue can be instead resolved by updating the UG! The transaction indexes were originally introduced to better keep track of the &lt;b>number&lt;/b> of transactions under the interested person, not really a fixed ID to search for a transaction.

Fixed all the PED issues linked and certain concerns raised regarding the previous time filter increment! I didn't really move on with the suggestion of merging the filtertime class with the filter command class as I believe that it is a good practice for our command designs to leave behind a general framework suitable for future expansion, which in this case has already been fulfilled by the separation of filter command and filter time command classes.

Most of the unhandled bugs were from the same source: when entering an invalid date or time, the dateTime object becomes null, hence if this object is still null after creating inflow/outflow/reminder, an error message will be shown to the user that there was incorrect input.

@shawnpong  @a-wild-chocolate 
Please note that I had to add lastHydrationEntryID member to hydration classes, and lastSleepEntryID member to sleep classes. You both have to work on the following on your own.

1. Allow newly added entries to have unique entryID
2. Allow entries to be deleted based on entryID
3. Allow entries with entry ID to be saved into txt file
4. Allow entries with entry ID to be read off from txt file

You may refer to my commits for more information. Thank you

Apologies for the inconvenience, but this CLI app is designed for users who type fast. For a fast typer who types 80-100 WPM, pressing 14 keys should take no more than 1 second. Hence, it should not be considered a flaw as this feature is clearly stated at the beginning of our product user guide

Yes. The getUserSaveDirection() method prompts the user for input and expects an integer corresponding to the direction to save the penalty. The input is read as a string and then converted into an integer using the convertToShootDirection() method, which checks if the input is within the valid range (0, 1, or 2).

The convertToShootDirection() method is designed to parse the argument for the "save" command, which should be an integer within the range (0, 1, or 2). The string passed to this method is expected to be just the argument part of the input, not the full command. In the case of the "save 1" command, only "1" would be passed to convertToShootDirection(). This is handled by the Parser class, which splits the full input string into the command and argument tokens.

with this code, it blocks the user from using the shoot and save command when not in a match, but it also blocks them from using them when in a match. I think the isInGame does not get updated correctly in the MatchStat class

My bug is fixed, which was due to a naming issue (better to set a utility class to `final`). I can see there is still some bugs on @hongyijie06 side.

In the `Parser.java` of your latest PR, I can see you called a `processStartCommand()` function in the `parseCommand` function. However, the `processStartCommand` is not implemented in your code.

The style check cannot pass due to the original file cannot pass. Some magic param in original version before my push cannot pass the style check, please have a look at the style about DELETE_PADDING and SIZE_OF_DELETE in CalorieList.java and LiquidList.java, gradle shows them wrong. So I have to change them to deletePadding and sizeOfDelete...

I managed to replicate it by adding an extra newline after the command, which should not be added according to the command given in the guide.

Hence, I have added to the UG asking users to ensure that they have followed the UG command instructions _**closely and exactly**_ to prevent such errors.

Fixed.

Instructions added in the UG  under **`Notes about command format`** and **`FAQs`** question 7 to highlight to users the risks of getting errors thrown due to extra and/or missing characters in the commands.
