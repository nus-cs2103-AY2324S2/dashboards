Hi prof,

I submitted week 6's exercises on coursemology, which passed all test cases when I tested them before submission, however, when I finalise the submission the grades didn't show up as usual. There seems to be some issue with the auto-grader.
Could you help me check it from the course instructor's side?
Thank you.

As shown, it has been evaluating the answer since 30min ago:

Hi prof, may I ask for a method that involves a switch like this, is there a need to add a `break;` at the end of each case?
Because when I add a `break` after a `return`, the IDE warns me that the break line is an unreachable statement.
```
MyClass foo(int case) ``{``
    switch (case) ``{``
    case 0:
        return A;
        // break; ?
    case 1:
        return B;
        // break; ?
    case 2:
        return C;
        // break; ?
    default:
        return D;
        // break; ?

Hi prof Akshay!
I'd like to clarify some ip specifications.
I understand that we are encouraged to customize the command/display formats. Does this mean that we can name the commands differently? e.g. instead of `bye` for exiting the app, can I use `exit`? And can I allow the user to use multiple keywords to perform the same action? e.g. both `bye` and `exit` will terminate the app.

Moreover, does "customizing the personality of the chatbot" just mean changing the given prompts shown in the ip examples? 
Are we allowed to add new features, or even alter the given mechanism? e.g. I'm thinking of adding an extra confirmation step for some commands.

Hi prof!
The readme specifies that JDK 11 should be used. May I ask if it is equivalent to set the project language level to Java 11 while using another version of JDK? Will it possibly affect the grading process? Thank you.

Sorry I just wanted to tag along with your question as I have a closely related one. 
Java seems to allow a shorter syntax for array initialization: `int[] X = ``{``1, 2, 3``}``;`, which I feel is more readable than the one with `new int[]`. I wonder which one is preferred in this course?

Looks like there may be a lack of permissions for the GitHub runner to execute your shell script. Perhaps you might want to look at 
[this](https://aileenrae.co.uk/blog/github-actions-shell-script-permission-denied-error/) or [this](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/26239) to try and fix it?
It looks like you will either have to: 1) update your gradle.yml file or 2) update the file locally and push it to your fork.

Hope it helps!

It might possibly be due to your expected.txt file having Windows Line Separators while the macOS and *nix GitHub runners produce *nix line separators for actual.txt.

You can consider a few options:
1. Use a macOS/Unix machine to generate another expected outputs file (perhaps label it expected-unix.txt?) and create another actual outputs file (actual-unix.txt?). In your .bat script (which runs on Windows) you should check diffs for actual.txt and expected.txt while your .sh script (unix and mac) should check diffs for actual-unix.txt and expected-unix.txt
2. You should be able to achieve the same effect by writing a script that auto generates the required unix files with the correct line separators, but anytime you update your text I/O tests you have to run the script to generate the updated files.
3. You can choose to delete the text I/O tests from your repo, as Prof has mentioned they are not needed.

Hope this helps!

Hi prof and TAs,

I made a mistake while doing week 7 ip in regards to branching for A-JavaDoc increment. I did not realize I had to do parallel branching and merging pull requests for adding the documentation. What I did was after completing the merging and pull requests for Level-8 and Level-9, I directly committed the A-JavaDoc increment onto the master branch and pushed it to github. However, attempting to use git reset now is risky as it might mess up the repo(?).

I understand that according to the marking rubrics, we just need to satisfy at least 4 weeks of the git/ github requirements in order to score full marks for the "project management" section. May I confirm if I leave it as it is, I won't be penalized? I have made sure to follow all of the git/github requirements for past weeks.

Attached is a screenshot (Note that the merging connections here looks a bit more complicated/ strange(?) because I selected the option "create a new commit even if fast forward is possible" when pulling from my github repo after merging each pull request but it essentially should be the same as what was requested in the instructions)

Thank you!

Hi prof,

But assuming the other tasks have been done correctly, just for this particular branching mistake (didnt create a parallel branch for A-JavaDoc), am I right to say that it can be omitted towards the counting of "following at least 4 weeks of the git/ github requirements"? Thank you.

For week 7 iP we were given instructions to "tag the merge commit in the master branch". However, I realized later on that my commits had a bug that would throw an error if a deadline is stored in the storage file when reading the file initially. I have since resolved the error, but I am wondering if I should tag the latest commit instead?

The buggy branch was branch-Level-8, however I have already pushed it to the fork, pulled it to master and merged with branch-Level-9 and branch-A-JavaDoc, causing both branches to contain the bug as well. Furthermore, I have already committed the fix to the master branch. May I know how I can resolve this?

Hi, I have a quick question on the weekly progress report for IP and how it will affect our grades. During week 4, I was working on event, todo, and deadline a lot throughout the week, but I have a really bad habit of only committing when I am finished with the final task (which is why my commit came in during week 5 instead of 4). I am actively working on that (especially this week I made it my goal to make commits as I am working rather than waiting till the end). 

Will I lose points for not committing anything during week 4? I definitely know it's not the best software engineering practice to not commit often, and I am working on that moving forward, but I hope that it doesn't affect my grade because I forgot to do it that week.

Hi, When first starting this project I was a bit confused on tagging so I labeled by commit messages as "Level-0" and "Level-1" (and so onward), instead of a descriptive message detailing what I did. I later realized what was meant by tagging, and added that to the respective commits, but after doing some research online, I found that I am unable to change my commit messages without messing up the timeline of my commits (ie force pushing to my commit history, which I don't necessarily want to do). 

Is it ok that my initial commit messages aren't detailed? Will I lose points on this? Should I force push to make them more descriptive?

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Type Inference when instantiating generic classes**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2113-AY2324S2/forum/issues/18" expanded>

Hi, I'd like to ask if type inference is considered an acceptable coding practice (when instantiating generic classes).

Normally, we would create new instances of generic classes as such:
`List&lt;Integer> newList = new ArrayList&lt;Integer>(); // No type inference`

However, we can use type inference here:
`List&lt;Integer> newList = new ArrayList&lt;>(); // Type inference used`

I can't seem to find any guidance regarding this (on both the provided style guide, as well as the Google style guide). I would appreciate some insight regarding this. Thanks!

PS: IntelliJ's linter seems to recommend using type inference. But I was also taught previously that we should try to avoid type inference when possible.

Hi, I think this expression `Integer newValue = roster.get(day) + 1;` is ok. 
Since `roster.get(day)` would return a Integer instance and by adding 1, the integer instance is unboxed into int to perform the addition. When the addition result is assigned to `newValue` it is boxed into an Integer. These processes is done automatically by Java, which is equivalent to do `Integer newValue = Integer.valueOf(roster.get(day).intValue() + 1);` where u are boxing and unboxing manually.

hi all, i have some questions regarding the following requirements.

1. "Save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the task list changes. Load the data from the hard disk when the chatbot starts up.". 

- should we store data from previous runs or just write new content in the file each time the chatbot starts up (like overwrite the content from previous runs). 
- If data retention is necessary, is it required to be able to manipulate previous tasks, such as marking or deleting tasks added in previous runs? 
- Additionally, is it necessary to save tasks on every change (e.g., marking), or is saving only required at the last step when the user ends the chatbot?


2. "Your code must handle the case where the data file doesn't exist at the start. Similarly, if you expect the data file to be in as specific folder (e.g., ./data/), you must also handle the folder-does-not-exist-yet case.".  

- does this mean that when we first run the chatbot, we have to create the folder/file if it doesn't exist yet, rather than just attempting to open the file and write to it?

Thanks in advance for any input or suggestions.

Apart from the points mentioned by [clarencepohh](https://github.com/clarencepohh) and [ChinYanXu](https://github.com/ChinYanXu), perhaps it could be due to some missing spaces or newlines?

Hello Anne. You could try replacing your newline characters with `System.lineSeparator()` . To my knowledge it is a system dependent newline and thus addresses the points [clarencepohh](https://github.com/clarencepohh) raised about macOS and Windows using different newline characters. More information can be found here [](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-lineseparator-method-in-java-with-examples/) . Hope this helps!

Hi all, would like to ask about autoboxing/ unboxing in Java.

The partial solution for Wk6 "Weekly Roster" has this line of code: 
``` Integer newValue = Integer.valueOf(roster.get(day).intValue() + 1); ```.

Would like to ask if we can just type: 
``` Integer newValue = roster.get(day) + 1; ```
as Java does autoboxing/ unboxing for us (see https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/autoboxing-unboxing-java/).

Or is this a code standard thing?

Would appreciate any clarifications/ inputs, thank you!

Yes, I agree with @JackieNeoCEG. Just to add on, using `break` statements in place of `return` statements would be necessary if you have additional code after the `switch` statement and need to run it. But in this case, it is not necessary (and unreachable due to aforementioned reason by @JackieNeoCEG ).

The first question is regarding the git commit message subject
I want to follow the commit message subject styling [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/), in addition to those mentioned in the SE-Education.

In it I add a commit type to each commit, and then capitalising the first letter of the description that follows.
Which essentially transform commit messages from

`Add input handling` 
`Update installation guide`
`Shift processing to Processing class`

to

`feat: Add input handling` 
`docs: Update installation guide`
`refactor: Shift processing to Processing class`

I would like to ask if this is allowed or is it not advised.

The second question is regarding Java styling conventions.
Should there be a space before the left brace of the array initializer, i.e
```
int[] X = new int[] ``{``1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 87, 1213, 2``}``;
int[] empty = new int[] ``{````}``;
```
instead of 
```
int[] X = new int[]``{``1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 87, 1213, 2``}``;
int[] empty = new int[]``{````}``;
```

What I did on my end is to manually populate the input.txt with the commands I want to test that is relevant to my program.
e.g "todo read book" then "list". Perhaps someone else could verify if they did the same too?
